To increase your backup plan window using the API, see UpdateBackupPlan . You can also increase your backup plan window using the Console by choosing and editing your backup plan.\n\nEXPIRED status indicates that the recovery point has exceeded its retention period, but Backup lacks permission or is otherwise unable to delete it. To manually delete these recovery points, see Step 3: Delete the recovery points in the Clean up resources section of Getting started .\n\nStatusMessage -> (string)\n\nA status message explaining the reason for the recovery point deletion failure.\n\nCreationDate -> (timestamp)\n\nThe date and time that a recovery point is created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

Backup transitions and expires backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.\n\nBackups that are transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting. The “transition to cold after days” setting cannot be changed after a backup has been transitioned to cold.\n\nOnly Amazon EFS file system backups can be transitioned to cold storage.\n\nMoveToColdStorageAfterDays -> (long)\n\nSpecifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is moved to cold storage.\n\nDeleteAfterDays -> (long)\n\nSpecifies the number of days after creation that a recovery point is deleted.

The format of the ARN depends on the resource type.\n\n--iam-role-arn (string)\n\nSpecifies the IAM role ARN used to create the target recovery point; for example, arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/S3Access .\n\n--idempotency-token (string)\n\nA customer-chosen string that you can use to distinguish between otherwise identical calls to StartBackupJob .

This value is optional, and the default is 8 hours.\n\n--complete-window-minutes (long)\n\nA value in minutes during which a successfully started backup must complete, or else AWS Backup will cancel the job. This value is optional. This value begins counting down from when the backup was scheduled. It does not add additional time for StartWindowMinutes , or if the backup started later than scheduled.\n\n--lifecycle (structure)\n\nThe lifecycle defines when a protected resource is transitioned to cold storage and when it expires. Backup will transition and expire backups automatically according to the lifecycle that you define.\n\nBackups transitioned to cold storage must be stored in cold storage for a minimum of 90 days. Therefore, the “expire after days” setting must be 90 days greater than the “transition to cold after days” setting.

Set to \"WindowsVSS\"\"disabled\" to create a regular backup.
