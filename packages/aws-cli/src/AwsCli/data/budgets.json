This must start from the current month and include the next 11 months. The key is the start of the month, UTC in epoch seconds.\n\nFor quarterly budgets, provide 4 quarters of PlannedBudgetLimits value entries in standard calendar quarter increments. This must start from the current quarter and include the next 3 quarters. The key is the start of the quarter, UTC in epoch seconds.\n\nIf the planned budget expires before 12 months for monthly or 4 quarters for quarterly, provide the PlannedBudgetLimits values only for the remaining periods.\n\nIf the budget begins at a date in the future, provide PlannedBudgetLimits values from the start date of the budget.\n\nAfter all of the BudgetLimit values in PlannedBudgetLimits are used, the budget continues to use the last limit as the BudgetLimit . At that point, the planned budget provides the same experience as a fixed budget.\n\nDescribeBudget and DescribeBudgets response along with PlannedBudgetLimits will also contain BudgetLimit representing the current month or quarter limit present in PlannedBudgetLimits .

For example, if you created your budget on January 24, 2018, chose DAILY , and didn’t set a start date, AWS set your start date to 01/24/18 00:00 UTC . If you chose MONTHLY , AWS set your start date to 01/01/18 00:00 UTC . If you didn’t specify an end date, AWS set your end date to 06/15/87 00:00 UTC .

If you created your budget and didn’t specify a start date, AWS defaults to the start of your chosen time period (DAILY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, or ANNUALLY).

The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

  "service_description": "Description\n\nThe AWS Budgets API enables you to use AWS Budgets to plan your service usage, service costs, and instance reservations. The API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for AWS Budgets.\n\nBudgets provide you with a way to see the following information:\n\nHow close your plan is to your budgeted amount or to the free tier limits\n\nYour usage-to-date, including how much you’ve used of your Reserved Instances (RIs)\n\nYour current estimated charges from AWS, and how much your predicted usage will accrue in charges by the end of the month\n\nHow much of your budget has been used\n\nAWS updates your budget status several times a day. Budgets track your unblended costs, subscriptions, refunds, and RIs. You can create the following types of budgets:\n\nCost budgets - Plan how much you want to spend on a service.\n\nUsage budgets - Plan how much you want to use one or more services.\n\nRI utilization budgets - Define a utilization threshold, and receive alerts when your RI usage falls below that threshold. This lets you see if your RIs are unused or under-utilized.\n\nRI coverage budgets - Define a coverage threshold, and receive alerts when the number of your instance hours that are covered by RIs fall below that threshold. This lets you see how much of your instance usage is covered by a reservation.\n\nService Endpoint\n\nThe AWS Budgets API provides the following endpoint:\n\nhttps://budgets.amazonaws.com\n\nFor information about costs that are associated with the AWS Budgets API, see AWS Cost Management Pricing ."
