GUID generation is unique within a region.\n\n--dataset-name (string) A string of up to 128 characters. Allowed characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9, ‘_’ (underscore), ‘-‘ (dash), and ‘.’ (dot).\n\n--device-id (string)\n\nThe unique ID generated for this device by Cognito.\n\n--record-patches (list) A list of patch operations.(structure)\n\nAn update operation for a record.\n\nOp -> (string)\n\nAn operation, either replace or remove.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nThe key associated with the record patch.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe value associated with the record patch.\n\nSyncCount -> (long)\n\nLast known server sync count for this record. Set to 0 if unknown.\n\nDeviceLastModifiedDate -> (timestamp)\n\nThe last modified date of the client device.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nOp=string,Key=string,Value=string,SyncCount=long,DeviceLastModifiedDate=timestamp ...\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Op\": \"replace\"|\"remove\",\n    \"Key\": \"string\",\n    \"Value\": \"string\",\n    \"SyncCount\": long,\n    \"DeviceLastModifiedDate\": timestamp\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--sync-session-token (string) The SyncSessionToken returned by a previous call to ListRecords for this dataset and identity.\n\n--client-context (string) Intended to supply a device ID that will populate the lastModifiedBy field referenced in other methods. The ClientContext field is not yet implemented.\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

  "service_description": "Description\n\nAmazon Cognito Sync provides an AWS service and client library that enable cross-device syncing of application-related user data. High-level client libraries are available for both iOS and Android. You can use these libraries to persist data locally so that it’s available even if the device is offline. Developer credentials don’t need to be stored on the mobile device to access the service. You can use Amazon Cognito to obtain a normalized user ID and credentials. User data is persisted in a dataset that can store up to 1 MB of key-value pairs, and you can have up to 20 datasets per user identity.\n\nWith Amazon Cognito Sync, the data stored for each identity is accessible only to credentials assigned to that identity. In order to use the Cognito Sync service, you need to make API calls using credentials retrieved with Amazon Cognito Identity service .\n\nIf you want to use Cognito Sync in an Android or iOS application, you will probably want to make API calls via the AWS Mobile SDK. To learn more, see the Developer Guide for Android and the Developer Guide for iOS ."
