The key prefix is similar to a directory name that enables you to store similar data under the same directory in a bucket.\n\nKmsKeyArn -> (string)\n\nThe customer master key that Amazon SES should use to encrypt your emails before saving them to the Amazon S3 bucket. You can use the default master key or a custom master key you created in AWS KMS as follows:\n\nTo use the default master key, provide an ARN in the form of arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:alias/aws/ses . For example, if your AWS account ID is 123456789012 and you want to use the default master key in the US West (Oregon) region, the ARN of the default master key would be arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses . If you use the default master key, you don’t need to perform any extra steps to give Amazon SES permission to use the key.\n\nTo use a custom master key you created in AWS KMS, provide the ARN of the master key and ensure that you add a statement to your key’s policy to give Amazon SES permission to use it. For more information about giving permissions, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nFor more information about key policies, see the AWS KMS Developer Guide . If you do not specify a master key, Amazon SES will not encrypt your emails.\n\nWarning\n\nYour mail is encrypted by Amazon SES using the Amazon S3 encryption client before the mail is submitted to Amazon S3 for storage. It is not encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. This means that you must use the Amazon S3 encryption client to decrypt the email after retrieving it from Amazon S3, as the service has no access to use your AWS KMS keys for decryption. This encryption client is currently available with the AWS SDK for Java and AWS SDK for Ruby only. For more information about client-side encryption using AWS KMS master keys, see the Amazon S3 Developer Guide .\n\nBounceAction -> (structure)\n\nRejects the received email by returning a bounce response to the sender and, optionally, publishes a notification to Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).\n\nTopicArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to notify when the bounce action is taken.

For more information about Amazon SNS topics, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .\n\nSmtpReplyCode -> (string)\n\nThe SMTP reply code, as defined by RFC 5321 .\n\nStatusCode -> (string)\n\nThe SMTP enhanced status code, as defined by RFC 3463 .\n\nMessage -> (string)\n\nHuman-readable text to include in the bounce message.\n\nSender -> (string)\n\nThe email address of the sender of the bounced email. This is the address from which the bounce message will be sent.\n\nWorkmailAction -> (structure)\n\nCalls Amazon WorkMail and, optionally, publishes a notification to Amazon Amazon SNS.\n\nTopicArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to notify when the WorkMail action is called. An example of an Amazon SNS topic ARN is arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic . For more information about Amazon SNS topics, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .\n\nOrganizationArn -> (string)\n\nThe ARN of the Amazon WorkMail organization. An example of an Amazon WorkMail organization ARN is arn:aws:workmail:us-west-2:123456789012:organization/m-68755160c4cb4e29a2b2f8fb58f359d7 . For information about Amazon WorkMail organizations, see the Amazon WorkMail Administrator Guide .\n\nLambdaAction -> (structure)\n\nCalls an AWS Lambda function, and optionally, publishes a notification to Amazon SNS.\n\nTopicArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to notify when the Lambda action is taken. An example of an Amazon SNS topic ARN is arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic . For more information about Amazon SNS topics, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .\n\nFunctionArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Lambda function. An example of an AWS Lambda function ARN is arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:account-id:function:MyFunction . For more information about AWS Lambda, see the AWS Lambda Developer Guide .\n\nInvocationType -> (string)\n\nThe invocation type of the AWS Lambda function. An invocation type of RequestResponse means that the execution of the function will immediately result in a response, and a value of Event means that the function will be invoked asynchronously.

You can use the default master key or a custom master key you created in AWS KMS as follows:\n\nTo use the default master key, provide an ARN in the form of arn:aws:kms:REGION:ACCOUNT-ID-WITHOUT-HYPHENS:alias/aws/ses . For example, if your AWS account ID is 123456789012 and you want to use the default master key in the US West (Oregon) region, the ARN of the default master key would be arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses . If you use the default master key, you don’t need to perform any extra steps to give Amazon SES permission to use the key.\n\nTo use a custom master key you created in AWS KMS, provide the ARN of the master key and ensure that you add a statement to your key’s policy to give Amazon SES permission to use it. For more information about giving permissions, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nFor more information about key policies, see the AWS KMS Developer Guide . If you do not specify a master key, Amazon SES will not encrypt your emails.\n\nWarning\n\nYour mail is encrypted by Amazon SES using the Amazon S3 encryption client before the mail is submitted to Amazon S3 for storage. It is not encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. This means that you must use the Amazon S3 encryption client to decrypt the email after retrieving it from Amazon S3, as the service has no access to use your AWS KMS keys for decryption.

For information about verifying identities, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nIf you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the SourceArn parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nNote\n\nAmazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in RFC6531 . For this reason, the local part of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain 7-bit ASCII characters . If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492 . The sender name (also known as the friendly name ) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in RFC 2047 .

      "command_description": "Description\n\nComposes an email message and immediately queues it for sending.\n\nThis operation is more flexible than the SendEmail API operation. When you use the SendRawEmail operation, you can specify the headers of the message as well as its content. This flexibility is useful, for example, when you want to send a multipart MIME email (such a message that contains both a text and an HTML version). You can also use this operation to send messages that include attachments.\n\nThe SendRawEmail operation has the following requirements:\n\nYou can only send email from verified email addresses or domains . If you try to send email from an address that isn’t verified, the operation results in an “Email address not verified” error.\n\nIf your account is still in the Amazon SES sandbox , you can only send email to other verified addresses in your account, or to addresses that are associated with the Amazon SES mailbox simulator .\n\nThe maximum message size, including attachments, is 10 MB.\n\nEach message has to include at least one recipient address. A recipient address includes any address on the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines.\n\nIf you send a single message to more than one recipient address, and one of the recipient addresses isn’t in a valid format (that is, it’s not in the format UserName@[SubDomain.]Domain.TopLevelDomain ), Amazon SES rejects the entire message, even if the other addresses are valid.\n\nEach message can include up to 50 recipient addresses across the To:, CC:, or BCC: lines. If you need to send a single message to more than 50 recipients, you have to split the list of recipient addresses into groups of less than 50 recipients, and send separate messages to each group.\n\nAmazon SES allows you to specify 8-bit Content-Transfer-Encoding for MIME message parts. However, if Amazon SES has to modify the contents of your message (for example, if you use open and click tracking), 8-bit content isn’t preserved. For this reason, we highly recommend that you encode all content that isn’t 7-bit ASCII. For more information, see MIME Encoding in the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nAdditionally, keep the following considerations in mind when using the SendRawEmail operation:\n\nAlthough you can customize the message headers when using the SendRawEmail operation, Amazon SES will automatically apply its own Message-ID and Date headers; if you passed these headers when creating the message, they will be overwritten by the values that Amazon SES provides.\n\nIf you are using sending authorization to send on behalf of another user, SendRawEmail enables you to specify the cross-account identity for the email’s Source, From, and Return-Path parameters in one of two ways: you can pass optional parameters SourceArn , FromArn , and/or ReturnPathArn to the API, or you can include the following X-headers in the header of your raw email:\n\nX-SES-SOURCE-ARN\n\nX-SES-FROM-ARN\n\nX-SES-RETURN-PATH-ARN\n\nWarning\n\nDon’t include these X-headers in the DKIM signature. Amazon SES removes these before it sends the email.\n\nIf you only specify the SourceIdentityArn parameter, Amazon SES sets the From and Return-Path addresses to the same identity that you specified.\n\nFor more information about sending authorization, see the Using Sending Authorization with Amazon SES in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.\n\nFor every message that you send, the total number of recipients (including each recipient in the To:, CC: and BCC: fields) is counted against the maximum number of emails you can send in a 24-hour period (your sending quota ). For more information about sending quotas in Amazon SES, see Managing Your Amazon SES Sending Limits in the Amazon SES Developer Guide.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

For a list on unsupported content types, see Unsupported Attachment Types in the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nThe entire message must be base64-encoded.\n\nIf any of the MIME parts in your message contain content that is outside of the 7-bit ASCII character range, we highly recommend that you encode that content. For more information, see Sending Raw Email in the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nPer RFC 5321 , the maximum length of each line of text, including the <CRLF>, must not exceed 1,000 characters.\n\nData -> (blob)\n\nThe raw data of the message. This data needs to base64-encoded if you are accessing Amazon SES directly through the HTTPS interface. If you are accessing Amazon SES using an AWS SDK, the SDK takes care of the base 64-encoding for you. In all cases, the client must ensure that the message format complies with Internet email standards regarding email header fields, MIME types, and MIME encoding.\n\nThe To:, CC:, and BCC: headers in the raw message can contain a group list.\n\nIf you are using SendRawEmail with sending authorization, you can include X-headers in the raw message to specify the “Source,” “From,” and “Return-Path” addresses. For more information, see the documentation for SendRawEmail .\n\nWarning\n\nDo not include these X-headers in the DKIM signature, because they are removed by Amazon SES before sending the email.\n\nFor more information, go to the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nData=blob\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"Data\": blob\n}\n\n\n--from-arn (string)\n\nThis parameter is used only for sending authorization.

This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES. For information about verifying identities, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nIf you are sending on behalf of another user and have been permitted to do so by a sending authorization policy, then you must also specify the SourceArn parameter. For more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nNote\n\nAmazon SES does not support the SMTPUTF8 extension, as described in RFC6531 . For this reason, the local part of a source email address (the part of the email address that precedes the @ sign) may only contain 7-bit ASCII characters . If the domain part of an address (the part after the @ sign) contains non-ASCII characters, they must be encoded using Punycode, as described in RFC3492 . The sender name (also known as the friendly name ) may contain non-ASCII characters. These characters must be encoded using MIME encoded-word syntax, as described in`RFC 2047 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047>`__ . MIME encoded-word syntax uses the following form: =?charset?encoding?encoded-text?= .\n\n--destination (structure)\n\nThe destination for this email, composed of To:, CC:, and BCC: fields.

If the message cannot be delivered to the recipient, then an error message will be returned from the recipient’s ISP; this message will then be forwarded to the email address specified by the ReturnPath parameter. The ReturnPath parameter is never overwritten. This email address must be either individually verified with Amazon SES, or from a domain that has been verified with Amazon SES.\n\n--source-arn (string)\n\nThis parameter is used only for sending authorization. It is the ARN of the identity that is associated with the sending authorization policy that permits you to send for the email address specified in the Source parameter.\n\nFor example, if the owner of example.com (which has ARN arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com ) attaches a policy to it that authorizes you to send from user@example.com , then you would specify the SourceArn to be arn:aws:ses:us-east-1:123456789012:identity/example.com , and the Source to be user@example.com .\n\nFor more information about sending authorization, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\n--return-path-arn (string)\n\nThis parameter is used only for sending authorization.

Tags correspond to characteristics of the email that you define, so that you can publish email sending events.\n\n(structure)\n\nContains the name and value of a tag that you can provide to SendEmail or SendRawEmail to apply to an email.\n\nMessage tags, which you use with configuration sets, enable you to publish email sending events. For information about using configuration sets, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the tag. The name must:\n\nThis value can only contain ASCII letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), underscores (_), or dashes (-).\n\nContain less than 256 characters.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe value of the tag.

For example, if your AWS account ID is 123456789012 and you want to use the default master key in the US West (Oregon) region, the ARN of the default master key would be arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:123456789012:alias/aws/ses . If you use the default master key, you don’t need to perform any extra steps to give Amazon SES permission to use the key.\n\nTo use a custom master key you created in AWS KMS, provide the ARN of the master key and ensure that you add a statement to your key’s policy to give Amazon SES permission to use it. For more information about giving permissions, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nFor more information about key policies, see the AWS KMS Developer Guide . If you do not specify a master key, Amazon SES will not encrypt your emails.\n\nWarning\n\nYour mail is encrypted by Amazon SES using the Amazon S3 encryption client before the mail is submitted to Amazon S3 for storage. It is not encrypted using Amazon S3 server-side encryption. This means that you must use the Amazon S3 encryption client to decrypt the email after retrieving it from Amazon S3, as the service has no access to use your AWS KMS keys for decryption. This encryption client is currently available with the AWS SDK for Java and AWS SDK for Ruby only.

An example of an Amazon SNS topic ARN is arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic . For more information about Amazon SNS topics, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .\n\nFunctionArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the AWS Lambda function. An example of an AWS Lambda function ARN is arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:account-id:function:MyFunction . For more information about AWS Lambda, see the AWS Lambda Developer Guide .\n\nInvocationType -> (string)\n\nThe invocation type of the AWS Lambda function. An invocation type of RequestResponse means that the execution of the function will immediately result in a response, and a value of Event means that the function will be invoked asynchronously. The default value is Event . For information about AWS Lambda invocation types, see the AWS Lambda Developer Guide .\n\nWarning\n\nThere is a 30-second timeout on RequestResponse invocations. You should use Event invocation in most cases. Use RequestResponse only when you want to make a mail flow decision, such as whether to stop the receipt rule or the receipt rule set.\n\nStopAction -> (structure)\n\nTerminates the evaluation of the receipt rule set and optionally publishes a notification to Amazon SNS.\n\nScope -> (string)\n\nThe scope of the StopAction. The only acceptable value is RuleSet .\n\nTopicArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to notify when the stop action is taken. An example of an Amazon SNS topic ARN is arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic . For more information about Amazon SNS topics, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .\n\nAddHeaderAction -> (structure)\n\nAdds a header to the received email.\n\nHeaderName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the header to add. Must be between 1 and 50 characters, inclusive, and consist of alphanumeric (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) characters and dashes only.\n\nHeaderValue -> (string)\n\nMust be less than 2048 characters, and must not contain newline characters (“r” or “n”).\n\nSNSAction -> (structure)\n\nPublishes the email content within a notification to Amazon SNS.\n\nTopicArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon SNS topic to notify. An example of an Amazon SNS topic ARN is arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:123456789012:MyTopic . For more information about Amazon SNS topics, see the Amazon SNS Developer Guide .\n\nEncoding -> (string)\n\nThe encoding to use for the email within the Amazon SNS notification. UTF-8 is easier to use, but may not preserve all special characters when a message was encoded with a different encoding format. Base64 preserves all special characters. The default value is UTF-8.\n\nScanEnabled -> (boolean)\n\nIf true , then messages that this receipt rule applies to are scanned for spam and viruses. The default value is false .\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"Name\": \"string\",\n  \"Enabled\": true|false,\n  \"TlsPolicy\": \"Require\"|\"Optional\",\n  \"Recipients\": [\"string\", ...],\n  \"Actions\": [\n    {\n      \"S3Action\": {\n        \"TopicArn\": \"string\",\n        \"BucketName\": \"string\",\n        \"ObjectKeyPrefix\": \"string\",\n        \"KmsKeyArn\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"BounceAction\": {\n        \"TopicArn\": \"string\",\n        \"SmtpReplyCode\": \"string\",\n        \"StatusCode\": \"string\",\n        \"Message\": \"string\",\n        \"Sender\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"WorkmailAction\": {\n        \"TopicArn\": \"string\",\n        \"OrganizationArn\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"LambdaAction\": {\n        \"TopicArn\": \"string\",\n        \"FunctionArn\": \"string\",\n        \"InvocationType\": \"Event\"|\"RequestResponse\"\n      },\n      \"StopAction\": {\n        \"Scope\": \"RuleSet\",\n        \"TopicArn\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"AddHeaderAction\": {\n        \"HeaderName\": \"string\",\n        \"HeaderValue\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"SNSAction\": {\n        \"TopicArn\": \"string\",\n        \"Encoding\": \"UTF-8\"|\"Base64\"\n      }\n    }\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"ScanEnabled\": true|false\n}\n\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
