If this value is not specified, the ARN defaults to this environment’s creator.\n\n--tags (list)\n\nAn array of key-value pairs that will be associated with the new Cloud9 development environment.\n\n(structure)\n\nMetadata that is associated with Amazon Web Services resources. In particular, a name-value pair that can be associated with an Cloud9 development environment. There are two types of tags: user tags and system tags . A user tag is created by the user. A system tag is automatically created by Amazon Web Services services.
