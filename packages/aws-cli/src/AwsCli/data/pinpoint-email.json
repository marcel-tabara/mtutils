Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email.\n\nWhen you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon Pinpoint detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. It usually takes around 72 hours to complete the domain verification process.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

A tag is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.\n\nEach tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:\n\nTag keys and values are case sensitive.\n\nFor each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.\n\nThe aws: prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can’t edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource.\n\nYou can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nOne part of a key-value pair that defines a tag.

If you haven’t set up another mechanism for receiving bounce or complaint notifications, Amazon Pinpoint sends an email notification when these events occur (even if this setting is disabled).\n\nVerifiedForSendingStatus -> (boolean)\n\nSpecifies whether or not the identity is verified. In Amazon Pinpoint, you can only send email from verified email addresses or domains. For more information about verifying identities, see the Amazon Pinpoint User Guide .\n\nDkimAttributes -> (structure)\n\nAn object that contains information about the DKIM attributes for the identity.

If the value is false , then the messages that Amazon Pinpoint sends from the identity aren’t DKIM-signed.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nDescribes whether or not Amazon Pinpoint has successfully located the DKIM records in the DNS records for the domain. The status can be one of the following:\n\nPENDING – Amazon Pinpoint hasn’t yet located the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain, but will continue to attempt to locate them.\n\nSUCCESS – Amazon Pinpoint located the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain and determined that they’re correct. Amazon Pinpoint can now send DKIM-signed email from the identity.\n\nFAILED – Amazon Pinpoint was unable to locate the DKIM records in the DNS settings for the domain, and won’t continue to search for them.\n\nTEMPORARY_FAILURE – A temporary issue occurred, which prevented Amazon Pinpoint from determining the DKIM status for the domain.\n\nNOT_STARTED – Amazon Pinpoint hasn’t yet started searching for the DKIM records in the DKIM records for the domain.\n\nTokens -> (list)\n\nA set of unique strings that you use to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS configuration for your domain.

A tag is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource in Amazon Pinpoint. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.\n\nEach tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:\n\nTag keys and values are case sensitive.\n\nFor each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.\n\nThe aws: prefix is reserved for use by AWS; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can’t edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource.\n\nYou can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your AWS account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified AWS Region for your AWS account.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nOne part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don’t want a resource to have a specific tag value, don’t specify a value for this parameter. Amazon Pinpoint will set the value to an empty string."

  "service_description": "Description\n\nWelcome to the Amazon Pinpoint Email API Reference . This guide provides information about the Amazon Pinpoint Email API (version 1.0), including supported operations, data types, parameters, and schemas.\n\nAmazon Pinpoint is an AWS service that you can use to engage with your customers across multiple messaging channels. You can use Amazon Pinpoint to send email, SMS text messages, voice messages, and push notifications. The Amazon Pinpoint Email API provides programmatic access to options that are unique to the email channel and supplement the options provided by the Amazon Pinpoint API.\n\nIf you’re new to Amazon Pinpoint, you might find it helpful to also review the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide . The Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide provides tutorials, code samples, and procedures that demonstrate how to use Amazon Pinpoint features programmatically and how to integrate Amazon Pinpoint functionality into mobile apps and other types of applications. The guide also provides information about key topics such as Amazon Pinpoint integration with other AWS services and the limits that apply to using the service.\n\nThe Amazon Pinpoint Email API is available in several AWS Regions and it provides an endpoint for each of these Regions. For a list of all the Regions and endpoints where the API is currently available, see AWS Service Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference . To learn more about AWS Regions, see Managing AWS Regions in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .\n\nIn each Region, AWS maintains multiple Availability Zones. These Availability Zones are physically isolated from each other, but are united by private, low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant network connections. These Availability Zones enable us to provide very high levels of availability and redundancy, while also minimizing latency. To learn more about the number of Availability Zones that are available in each Region, see AWS Global Infrastructure ."
