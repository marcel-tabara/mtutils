provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

(string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

For example, if you specify three base segments for the segment, whether the resulting segment is based on all, any, or none of the base segments.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how to handle multiple dimensions for the segment. For example, if you specify three dimensions for the segment, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the dimensions.\n\nInclude -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how to handle multiple segment groups for the segment. For example, if the segment includes three segment groups, whether the resulting segment includes endpoints that match all, any, or none of the segment groups.\n\nSegmentType -> (string)\n\nThe segment type. Valid values are:\n\nDIMENSIONAL - A dynamic segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint data that’s reported by your app. Dynamic segments can change over time.\n\nIMPORT - A static segment, which is a segment that uses selection criteria that you specify and is based on endpoint definitions that you import from a file. Imported segments are static; they don’t change over time.\n\ntags -> (map)\n\nA string-to-string map of key-value pairs that identifies the tags that are associated with the segment. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nVersion -> (integer)\n\nThe version number of the segment."

This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

This is the default value. A high priority notification should trigger an alert, play a sound, or badge your app’s icon on the recipient’s device. /para>\n\nAmazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-priority request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.\n\nThe equivalent values for Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), formerly Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), are normal, for 5, and high, for 10. If you specify an FCM value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint accepts and converts the value to the corresponding APNs value.\n\nRawContent -> (string)\n\nThe raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload for the notification message. If specified, this value overrides all other content for the message.\n\nNote\n\nIf you specify the raw content of an APNs push notification, the message payload has to include the content-available key. The value of the content-available key has to be an integer, and can only be 0 or 1. If you’re sending a standard notification, set the value of content-available to 0. If you’re sending a silent (background) notification, set the value of content-available to 1. Additionally, silent notification payloads can’t include the alert, badge, or sound keys. For more information, see Generating a Remote Notification and Pushing Background Updates to Your App on the Apple Developer website.\n\nSilentPush -> (boolean)\n\nSpecifies whether the notification is a silent push notification. A silent (or background) push notification isn’t displayed on recipients’ devices. You can use silent push notifications to make small updates to your app, or to display messages in an in-app message center.\n\nAmazon Pinpoint uses this property to determine the correct value for the apns-push-type request header when it sends the notification message to APNs. If you specify a value of true for this property, Amazon Pinpoint sets the value for the apns-push-type header field to background.\n\nNote\n\nIf you specify the raw content of an APNs push notification, the message payload has to include the content-available key. For silent (background) notifications, set the value of content-available to 1. Additionally, the message payload for a silent notification can’t include the alert, badge, or sound keys. For more information, see Generating a Remote Notification and Pushing Background Updates to Your App on the Apple Developer website.\n\nApple has indicated that they will throttle “excessive” background notifications based on current traffic volumes. To prevent your notifications being throttled, Apple recommends that you send no more than 3 silent push notifications to each recipient per hour.\n\nSound -> (string)\n\nThe key for the sound to play when the recipient receives the push notification. The value for this key is the name of a sound file in your app’s main bundle or the Library/Sounds folder in your app’s data container. If the sound file can’t be found or you specify default for the value, the system plays the default alert sound.\n\nSubstitutions -> (map)\n\nThe default message variables to use in the notification message. You can override these default variables with individual address variables.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (list)\n\n(string)\n\nThreadId -> (string)\n\nThe key that represents your app-specific identifier for grouping notifications. If you provide a Notification Content app extension, you can use this value to group your notifications together.\n\nTimeToLive -> (integer)\n\nThe amount of time, in seconds, that APNs should store and attempt to deliver the push notification, if the service is unable to deliver the notification the first time. If this value is 0, APNs treats the notification as if it expires immediately and the service doesn’t store or try to deliver the notification again.\n\nAmazon Pinpoint specifies this value in the apns-expiration request header when it sends the notification message to APNs.\n\nTitle -> (string)\n\nThe title to display above the notification message on the recipient’s device.\n\nUrl -> (string)\n\nThe URL to open in the recipient’s default mobile browser, if a recipient taps the push notification and the value of the Action property is URL.\n\nBaiduMessage -> (structure)\n\nThe default push notification message for the Baidu (Baidu Cloud Push) channel.

provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",
      "command_output": "Output\n\nCampaignResponse -> (structure)\n\nProvides information about the status, configuration, and other settings for a campaign.\n\nAdditionalTreatments -> (list)\n\nAn array of responses, one for each treatment that you defined for the campaign, in addition to the default treatment.\n\n(structure)\n\nSpecifies the settings for a campaign treatment. A treatment is a variation of a campaign that’s used for A/B testing of a campaign.\n\nCustomDeliveryConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe delivery configuration settings for sending the treatment through a custom channel. This object is required if the MessageConfiguration object for the treatment specifies a CustomMessage object.\n\nDeliveryUri -> (string)\n\nThe destination to send the campaign or treatment to. This value can be one of the following:\n\nThe name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Lambda function to invoke to handle delivery of the campaign or treatment.\n\nThe URL for a web application or service that supports HTTPS and can receive the message. The URL has to be a full URL, including the HTTPS protocol.\n\nEndpointTypes -> (list)\n\nThe types of endpoints to send the campaign or treatment to. Each valid value maps to a type of channel that you can associate with an endpoint by using the ChannelType property of an endpoint.\n\n(string)\n\nId -> (string)\n\nThe unique identifier for the treatment.\n\nMessageConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe message configuration settings for the treatment.\n\nADMMessage -> (structure)\n\nThe message that the campaign sends through the ADM (Amazon Device Messaging) channel. If specified, this message overrides the default message.\n\nAction -> (string)\n\nThe action to occur if a recipient taps the push notification. Valid values are:\n\nOPEN_APP - Your app opens or it becomes the foreground app if it was sent to the background. This is the default action.\n\nDEEP_LINK - Your app opens and displays a designated user interface in the app. This setting uses the deep-linking features of iOS and Android.\n\nURL - The default mobile browser on the recipient’s device opens and loads the web page at a URL that you specify.\n\nBody -> (string)\n\nThe body of the notification message. The maximum number of characters is 200.\n\nImageIconUrl -> (string)\n\nThe URL of the image to display as the push-notification icon, such as the icon for the app.\n\nImageSmallIconUrl -> (string)\n\nThe URL of the image to display as the small, push-notification icon, such as a small version of the icon for the app.\n\nImageUrl -> (string)\n\nThe URL of an image to display in the push notification.\n\nJsonBody -> (string)\n\nThe JSON payload to use for a silent push notification.\n\nMediaUrl -> (string)\n\nThe URL of the image or video to display in the push notification.\n\nRawContent -> (string)\n\nThe raw, JSON-formatted string to use as the payload for the notification message. If specified, this value overrides all other content for the message.\n\nSilentPush -> (boolean)\n\nSpecifies whether the notification is a silent push notification, which is a push notification that doesn’t display on a recipient’s device. Silent push notifications can be used for cases such as updating an app’s configuration, displaying messages in an in-app message center, or supporting phone home functionality.\n\nTimeToLive -> (integer)\n\nThe number of seconds that the push-notification service should keep the message, if the service is unable to deliver the notification the first time. This value is converted to an expiration value when it’s sent to a push-notification service. If this value is 0, the service treats the notification as if it expires immediately and the service doesn’t store or try to deliver the notification again.\n\nThis value doesn’t apply to messages that are sent through the Amazon Device Messaging (ADM) service.\n\nTitle -> (string)\n\nThe title to display above the notification message on a recipient’s device.\n\nUrl -> (string)\n\nThe URL to open in a recipient’s default mobile browser, if a recipient taps the push notification and the value of the Action property is URL.\n\nAPNSMessage -> (structure)\n\nThe message that the campaign sends through the APNs (Apple Push Notification service) channel. If specified, this message overrides the default message.\n\nAction -> (string)\n\nThe action to occur if a recipient taps the push notification.

(string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",
      "command_output": "Output\n\nJourneyResponse -> (structure)\n\nProvides information about the status, configuration, and other settings for a journey.\n\nActivities -> (map)\n\nA map that contains a set of Activity objects, one object for each activity in the journey. For each Activity object, the key is the unique identifier (string) for an activity and the value is the settings for the activity.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies the configuration and other settings for an activity in a journey.\n\nCUSTOM -> (structure)\n\nThe settings for a custom message activity. This type of activity calls an AWS Lambda function or web hook that sends messages to participants.\n\nDeliveryUri -> (string)\n\nThe destination to send the campaign or treatment to. This value can be one of the following:\n\nThe name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an AWS Lambda function to invoke to handle delivery of the campaign or treatment.\n\nThe URL for a web application or service that supports HTTPS and can receive the message. The URL has to be a full URL, including the HTTPS protocol.\n\nEndpointTypes -> (list)\n\nThe types of endpoints to send the custom message to. Each valid value maps to a type of channel that you can associate with an endpoint by using the ChannelType property of an endpoint.\n\n(string)\n\nMessageConfig -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies the message data included in a custom channel message that’s sent to participants in a journey.\n\nData -> (string)\n\nThe message content that’s passed to an AWS Lambda function or to a web hook.\n\nNextActivity -> (string)\n\nThe unique identifier for the next activity to perform, after Amazon Pinpoint calls the AWS Lambda function or web hook.\n\nTemplateName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the custom message template to use for the message. If specified, this value must match the name of an existing message template.\n\nTemplateVersion -> (string)\n\nThe unique identifier for the version of the message template to use for the message. If specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. To retrieve a list of versions and version identifiers for a template, use the Template Versionsresource.\n\nIf you don’t specify a value for this property, Amazon Pinpoint uses the active version of the template. The active version is typically the version of a template that’s been most recently reviewed and approved for use, depending on your workflow. It isn’t necessarily the latest version of a template.\n\nConditionalSplit -> (structure)\n\nThe settings for a yes/no split activity. This type of activity sends participants down one of two paths in a journey, based on conditions that you specify.\n\nCondition -> (structure)\n\nThe conditions that define the paths for the activity, and the relationship between the conditions.\n\nConditions -> (list)\n\nThe conditions to evaluate for the activity.\n\n(structure)\n\nSpecifies a condition to evaluate for an activity in a journey.\n\nEventCondition -> (structure)\n\nThe dimension settings for the event that’s associated with the activity.\n\nDimensions -> (structure)\n\nThe dimensions for the event filter to use for the activity.\n\nAttributes -> (map)\n\nOne or more custom attributes that your application reports to Amazon Pinpoint. You can use these attributes as selection criteria when you create an event filter.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies attribute-based criteria for including or excluding endpoints from a segment.\n\nAttributeType -> (string)\n\nThe type of segment dimension to use. Valid values are:\n\nINCLUSIVE - endpoints that have attributes matching the values are included in the segment.\n\nEXCLUSIVE - endpoints that have attributes matching the values are excluded in the segment.\n\nCONTAINS - endpoints that have attributes’ substrings match the values are included in the segment.\n\nBEFORE - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT datetimes before the value are included in the segment.\n\nAFTER - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT datetimes after the value are included in the segment.\n\nON - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT dates on the value are included in the segment. Time is ignored in this comparison.\n\nBETWEEN - endpoints with attributes read as ISO_INSTANT datetimes between the values are included in the segment.\n\nValues -> (list)\n\nThe criteria values to use for the segment dimension. Depending on the value of the AttributeType property, endpoints are included or excluded from the segment if their attribute values match the criteria values.\n\n(string)\n\nEventType -> (structure)\n\nThe name of the event that causes the campaign to be sent or the journey activity to be performed. This can be a standard event that Amazon Pinpoint generates, such as _email.delivered. For campaigns, this can also be a custom event that’s specific to your application. For information about standard events, see Streaming Amazon Pinpoint Events in the Amazon Pinpoint Developer Guide .\n\nDimensionType -> (string)\n\nThe type of segment dimension to use.

Template names are case sensitive.\n\n--voice-template-request (structure)\n\nSpecifies the content and settings for a message template that can be used in messages that are sent through the voice channel.\n\nBody -> (string)\n\nThe text of the script to use in messages that are based on the message template, in plain text format.\n\nDefaultSubstitutions -> (string)\n\nA JSON object that specifies the default values to use for message variables in the message template. This object is a set of key-value pairs. Each key defines a message variable in the template. The corresponding value defines the default value for that variable. When you create a message that’s based on the template, you can override these defaults with message-specific and address-specific variables and values.\n\nLanguageCode -> (string)\n\nThe code for the language to use when synthesizing the text of the script in messages that are based on the message template. For a list of supported languages and the code for each one, see the Amazon Polly Developer Guide .\n\ntags -> (map)\n\nA string-to-string map of key-value pairs that defines the tags to associate with the message template. Each tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nTemplateDescription -> (string)\n\nA custom description of the message template.\n\nVoiceId -> (string)\n\nThe name of the voice to use when delivering messages that are based on the message template. For a list of supported voices, see the Amazon Polly Developer Guide .\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nBody=string,DefaultSubstitutions=string,LanguageCode=string,tags={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},TemplateDescription=string,VoiceId=string\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"Body\": \"string\",\n  \"DefaultSubstitutions\": \"string\",\n  \"LanguageCode\": \"string\",\n  \"tags\": {\"string\": \"string\"\n    ...},\n  \"TemplateDescription\": \"string\",\n  \"VoiceId\": \"string\"\n}\n\n\n--template-version (string)\n\nThe unique identifier for the version of the message template to update, retrieve information about, or delete. To retrieve identifiers and other information for all the versions of a template, use the Template Versionsresource.\n\nIf specified, this value must match the identifier for an existing template version. If specified for an update operation, this value must match the identifier for the latest existing version of the template. This restriction helps ensure that race conditions don’t occur.\n\nIf you don’t specify a value for this parameter, Amazon Pinpoint does the following:\n\nFor a get operation, retrieves information about the active version of the template.\n\nFor an update operation, saves the updates to (overwrites) the latest existing version of the template, if the create-new-version parameter isn’t used or is set to false.\n\nFor a delete operation, deletes the template, including all versions of the template.\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",
      "command_output": "Output\n\nMessageBody -> (structure)\n\nProvides information about an API request or response.\n\nMessage -> (string)\n\nThe message that’s returned from the API.\n\nRequestID -> (string)\n\nThe unique identifier for the request or response."
