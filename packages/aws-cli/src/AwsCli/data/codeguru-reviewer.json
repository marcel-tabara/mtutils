When you associate a repository, CodeGuru Reviewer reviews source code changes in the repository’s pull requests and provides automatic recommendations. You can view recommendations using the CodeGuru Reviewer console. For more information, see Recommendations in Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide.\n\nIf you associate a CodeCommit or S3 repository, it must be in the same Amazon Web Services Region and Amazon Web Services account where its CodeGuru Reviewer code reviews are configured.\n\nBitbucket and GitHub Enterprise Server repositories are managed by Amazon Web Services CodeStar Connections to connect to CodeGuru Reviewer. For more information, see Associate a repository in the Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer User Guide.\n\nNote\n\nYou cannot use the CodeGuru Reviewer SDK or the Amazon Web Services CLI to associate a GitHub repository with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer. To associate a GitHub repository, use the console.
