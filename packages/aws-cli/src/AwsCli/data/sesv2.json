A resource can have as many as 50 tags.\n\nEach tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:\n\nTag keys and values are case sensitive.\n\nFor each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.\n\nThe aws: prefix is reserved for use by Amazon Web Services; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can’t edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource.\n\nYou can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your Amazon Web Services account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified Amazon Web Services Region for your Amazon Web Services account.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nOne part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag.

Before you can use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you’re the owner of the identity, and that you’ve given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the identity.\n\nWhen you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email.\n\nWhen you verify a domain without specifying the DkimSigningAttributes object, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert these tokens into CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain. This verification method is known as Easy DKIM .\n\nAlternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known as Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the CreateEmailIdentity operation has to include the DkimSigningAttributes object. When you specify this object, you provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies the public key to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key.\n\nWhen you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain.

Note: the MANAGED_DOMAIN identity type is not supported.\n\nFeedbackForwardingStatus -> (boolean)\n\nThe feedback forwarding configuration for the identity.\n\nIf the value is true , you receive email notifications when bounce or complaint events occur. These notifications are sent to the address that you specified in the Return-Path header of the original email.\n\nYou’re required to have a method of tracking bounces and complaints. If you haven’t set up another mechanism for receiving bounce or complaint notifications (for example, by setting up an event destination), you receive an email notification when these events occur (even if this setting is disabled).\n\nVerifiedForSendingStatus -> (boolean)\n\nSpecifies whether or not the identity is verified. You can only send email from verified email addresses or domains. For more information about verifying identities, see the Amazon Pinpoint User Guide .\n\nDkimAttributes -> (structure)\n\nAn object that contains information about the DKIM attributes for the identity.\n\nSigningEnabled -> (boolean)\n\nIf the value is true , then the messages that you send from the identity are signed using DKIM. If the value is false , then the messages that you send from the identity aren’t DKIM-signed.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nDescribes whether or not Amazon SES has successfully located the DKIM records in the DNS records for the domain. The status can be one of the following:\n\nPENDING – The verification process was initiated, but Amazon SES hasn’t yet detected the DKIM records in the DNS configuration for the domain.\n\nSUCCESS – The verification process completed successfully.\n\nFAILED – The verification process failed. This typically occurs when Amazon SES fails to find the DKIM records in the DNS configuration of the domain.\n\nTEMPORARY_FAILURE – A temporary issue is preventing Amazon SES from determining the DKIM authentication status of the domain.\n\nNOT_STARTED – The DKIM verification process hasn’t been initiated for the domain.\n\nTokens -> (list)\n\nIf you used Easy DKIM to configure DKIM authentication for the domain, then this object contains a set of unique strings that you use to create a set of CNAME records that you add to the DNS configuration for your domain. When Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain, the DKIM authentication process is complete.\n\nIf you configured DKIM authentication for the domain by providing your own public-private key pair, then this object contains the selector for the public key.\n\nRegardless of the DKIM authentication method you use, Amazon SES searches for the appropriate records in the DNS configuration of the domain for up to 72 hours.\n\n(string)\n\nSigningAttributesOrigin -> (string)\n\nA string that indicates how DKIM was configured for the identity. These are the possible values:\n\nAWS_SES – Indicates that DKIM was configured for the identity by using Easy DKIM .\n\nEXTERNAL – Indicates that DKIM was configured for the identity by using Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM).\n\nNextSigningKeyLength -> (string)\n\n[Easy DKIM] The key length of the future DKIM key pair to be generated. This can be changed at most once per day.\n\nCurrentSigningKeyLength -> (string)\n\n[Easy DKIM] The key length of the DKIM key pair in use.\n\nLastKeyGenerationTimestamp -> (timestamp)\n\n[Easy DKIM] The last time a key pair was generated for this identity.\n\nMailFromAttributes -> (structure)\n\nAn object that contains information about the Mail-From attributes for the email identity.\n\nMailFromDomain -> (string)\n\nThe name of a domain that an email identity uses as a custom MAIL FROM domain.\n\nMailFromDomainStatus -> (string)\n\nThe status of the MAIL FROM domain. This status can have the following values:\n\nPENDING – Amazon SES hasn’t started searching for the MX record yet.\n\nSUCCESS – Amazon SES detected the required MX record for the MAIL FROM domain.\n\nFAILED – Amazon SES can’t find the required MX record, or the record no longer exists.\n\nTEMPORARY_FAILURE – A temporary issue occurred, which prevented Amazon SES from determining the status of the MAIL FROM domain.\n\nBehaviorOnMxFailure -> (string)\n\nThe action to take if the required MX record can’t be found when you send an email. When you set this value to UseDefaultValue , the mail is sent using amazonses.com as the MAIL FROM domain. When you set this value to RejectMessage , the Amazon SES API v2 returns a MailFromDomainNotVerified error, and doesn’t attempt to deliver the email.\n\nThese behaviors are taken when the custom MAIL FROM domain configuration is in the Pending , Failed , and TemporaryFailure states.\n\nPolicies -> (map)\n\nA map of policy names to policies.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nThe name of the policy.\n\nThe policy name cannot exceed 64 characters and can only include alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores.\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nThe text of the policy in JSON format. The policy cannot exceed 4 KB.\n\nFor information about the syntax of sending authorization policies, see the Amazon SES Developer Guide .\n\nTags -> (list)\n\nAn array of objects that define the tags (keys and values) that are associated with the email identity.\n\n(structure)\n\nAn object that defines the tags that are associated with a resource. A tag is a label that you optionally define and associate with a resource. Tags can help you categorize and manage resources in different ways, such as by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria. A resource can have as many as 50 tags.\n\nEach tag consists of a required tag key and an associated tag value , both of which you define. A tag key is a general label that acts as a category for a more specific tag value. A tag value acts as a descriptor within a tag key. A tag key can contain as many as 128 characters. A tag value can contain as many as 256 characters. The characters can be Unicode letters, digits, white space, or one of the following symbols: _ . : / = + -. The following additional restrictions apply to tags:\n\nTag keys and values are case sensitive.\n\nFor each associated resource, each tag key must be unique and it can have only one value.\n\nThe aws: prefix is reserved for use by Amazon Web Services; you can’t use it in any tag keys or values that you define. In addition, you can’t edit or remove tag keys or values that use this prefix. Tags that use this prefix don’t count against the limit of 50 tags per resource.\n\nYou can associate tags with public or shared resources, but the tags are available only for your Amazon Web Services account, not any other accounts that share the resource. In addition, the tags are available only for resources that are located in the specified Amazon Web Services Region for your Amazon Web Services account.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nOne part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag key is 128 characters. The minimum length is 1 character.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe optional part of a key-value pair that defines a tag. The maximum length of a tag value is 256 characters. The minimum length is 0 characters. If you don’t want a resource to have a specific tag value, don’t specify a value for this parameter. If you don’t specify a value, Amazon SES sets the value to an empty string.\n\nConfigurationSetName -> (string)\n\nThe configuration set used by default when sending from this identity."
