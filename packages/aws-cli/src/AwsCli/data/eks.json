You must have at least one Fargate profile in a cluster to be able to run pods on Fargate.\n\nThe Fargate profile allows an administrator to declare which pods run on Fargate and specify which pods run on which Fargate profile. This declaration is done through the profile’s selectors. Each profile can have up to five selectors that contain a namespace and labels. A namespace is required for every selector. The label field consists of multiple optional key-value pairs. Pods that match the selectors are scheduled on Fargate. If a to-be-scheduled pod matches any of the selectors in the Fargate profile, then that pod is run on Fargate.\n\nWhen you create a Fargate profile, you must specify a pod execution role to use with the pods that are scheduled with the profile. This role is added to the cluster’s Kubernetes Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for authorization so that the kubelet that is running on the Fargate infrastructure can register with your Amazon EKS cluster so that it can appear in your cluster as a node. The pod execution role also provides IAM permissions to the Fargate infrastructure to allow read access to Amazon ECR image repositories. For more information, see Pod Execution Role in the Amazon EKS User Guide .\n\nFargate profiles are immutable. However, you can create a new updated profile to replace an existing profile and then delete the original after the updated profile has finished creating.\n\nIf any Fargate profiles in a cluster are in the DELETING status, you must wait for that Fargate profile to finish deleting before you can create any other profiles in that cluster.\n\nFor more information, see Fargate Profile in the Amazon EKS User Guide .\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

You can update to the latest AMI version of your cluster’s current Kubernetes version by specifying your cluster’s Kubernetes version in the request. For more information, see Amazon EKS optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI versions in the Amazon EKS User Guide .\n\nYou cannot roll back a node group to an earlier Kubernetes version or AMI version.\n\nWhen a node in a managed node group is terminated due to a scaling action or update, the pods in that node are drained first. Amazon EKS attempts to drain the nodes gracefully and will fail if it is unable to do so.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.\n\nAmazon EKS runs up-to-date versions of the open-source Kubernetes software, so you can use all the existing plugins and tooling from the Kubernetes community. Applications running on Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications running on any standard Kubernetes environment, whether running in on-premises data centers or public clouds. This means that you can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modification required."
