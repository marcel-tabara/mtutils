To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using ModifyDBClusterParameterGroup . Once you’ve created a DB cluster parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB cluster using ModifyDBCluster . When you associate a new DB cluster parameter group with a running DB cluster, you need to reboot the DB instances in the DB cluster without failover for the new DB cluster parameter group and associated settings to take effect.\n\nWarning\n\nAfter you create a DB cluster parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB cluster that uses that DB cluster parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon Neptune to fully complete the create action before the DB cluster parameter group is used as the default for a new DB cluster. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB cluster, such as the character set for the default database defined by the character_set_database parameter. You can use the Parameter Groups option of the Amazon Neptune console or the DescribeDBClusterParameters command to verify that your DB cluster parameter group has been created or modified.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

To provide custom values for any of the parameters, you must modify the group after creating it using ModifyDBParameterGroup . Once you’ve created a DB parameter group, you need to associate it with your DB instance using ModifyDBInstance . When you associate a new DB parameter group with a running DB instance, you need to reboot the DB instance without failover for the new DB parameter group and associated settings to take effect.\n\nWarning\n\nAfter you create a DB parameter group, you should wait at least 5 minutes before creating your first DB instance that uses that DB parameter group as the default parameter group. This allows Amazon Neptune to fully complete the create action before the parameter group is used as the default for a new DB instance. This is especially important for parameters that are critical when creating the default database for a DB instance, such as the character set for the default database defined by the character_set_database parameter. You can use the Parameter Groups option of the Amazon Neptune console or the DescribeDBParameters command to verify that your DB parameter group has been created or modified.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

The Status property returns one of the following values:\n\nACTIVE - the IAM role ARN is associated with the DB cluster and can be used to access other Amazon services on your behalf.\n\nPENDING - the IAM role ARN is being associated with the DB cluster.\n\nINVALID - the IAM role ARN is associated with the DB cluster, but the DB cluster is unable to assume the IAM role in order to access other Amazon services on your behalf.\n\nFeatureName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the feature associated with the Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) role. For the list of supported feature names, see DBEngineVersion .\n\nIAMDatabaseAuthenticationEnabled -> (boolean)\n\nTrue if mapping of Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM) accounts to database accounts is enabled, and otherwise false.\n\nCloneGroupId -> (string)\n\nIdentifies the clone group to which the DB cluster is associated.\n\nClusterCreateTime -> (timestamp)\n\nSpecifies the time when the DB cluster was created, in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).\n\nCopyTagsToSnapshot -> (boolean)\n\nIf set to ``true`` , tags are copied to any snapshot of the DB cluster that is created.\n\nEnabledCloudwatchLogsExports -> (list)\n\nA list of log types that this DB cluster is configured to export to CloudWatch Logs.\n\n(string)\n\nDeletionProtection -> (boolean)\n\nIndicates whether or not the DB cluster has deletion protection enabled. The database can’t be deleted when deletion protection is enabled.\n\nCrossAccountClone -> (boolean)\n\nIf set to true , the DB cluster can be cloned across accounts.\n\nAutomaticRestartTime -> (timestamp)\n\nTime at which the DB cluster will be automatically restarted."

  "service_description": "Description\n\nAmazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service that makes it easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency. Amazon Neptune supports popular graph models Property Graph and W3C’s RDF, and their respective query languages Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, allowing you to easily build queries that efficiently navigate highly connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use cases such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and network security.\n\nThis interface reference for Amazon Neptune contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon Neptune. Note that Amazon Neptune is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied. In this reference, the parameter descriptions indicate whether a command is applied immediately, on the next instance reboot, or during the maintenance window. The reference structure is as follows, and we list following some related topics from the user guide."
