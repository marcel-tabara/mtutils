A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.\n\nWhen FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE . This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error.\n\nTo register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status PLACING , where a new game session is created for the match.\n\nIf any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where one or more players rejected the match, the ticket status is returned to SEARCHING to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to respond, the ticket status is set to CANCELLED , and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.\n\nLearn more\n\nAdd FlexMatch to a game client\n\nFlexMatch events (reference)\n\nRelated actions\n\nStartMatchmaking | DescribeMatchmaking | StopMatchmaking | AcceptMatch | StartMatchBackfill | All APIs by task\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

This operation is called from a game client or client service (such as a matchmaker) to request hosting resources for a new game session. In response, GameLift FleetIQ locates an available game server, places it in CLAIMED status for 60 seconds, and returns connection information that players can use to connect to the game server.\n\nTo claim a game server, identify a game server group. You can also specify a game server ID, although this approach bypasses GameLift FleetIQ placement optimization. Optionally, include game data to pass to the game server at the start of a game session, such as a game map or player information.\n\nWhen a game server is successfully claimed, connection information is returned. A claimed game server’s utilization status remains AVAILABLE while the claim status is set to CLAIMED for up to 60 seconds. This time period gives the game server time to update its status to UTILIZED (using UpdateGameServer ) once players join. If the game server’s status is not updated within 60 seconds, the game server reverts to unclaimed status and is available to be claimed by another request. The claim time period is a fixed value and is not configurable.\n\nIf you try to claim a specific game server, this request will fail in the following cases:\n\nIf the game server utilization status is UTILIZED .\n\nIf the game server claim status is CLAIMED .\n\nNote\n\nWhen claiming a specific game server, this request will succeed even if the game server is running on an instance in DRAINING status.

Use this operation to configure the computing resources for your fleet and provide instructions for running game servers on each instance.\n\nMost GameLift fleets can deploy instances to multiple locations, including the home Region (where the fleet is created) and an optional set of remote locations. Fleets that are created in the following AWS Regions support multiple locations: us-east-1 (N. Virginia), us-west-2 (Oregon), eu-central-1 (Frankfurt), eu-west-1 (Ireland), ap-southeast-2 (Sydney), ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo), and ap-northeast-2 (Seoul). Fleets that are created in other GameLift Regions can deploy instances in the fleet’s home Region only. All fleet instances use the same configuration regardless of location; however, you can adjust capacity settings and turn auto-scaling on/off for each location.\n\nTo create a fleet, choose the hardware for your instances, specify a game server build or Realtime script to deploy, and provide a runtime configuration to direct GameLift how to start and run game servers on each instance in the fleet. Set permissions for inbound traffic to your game servers, and enable optional features as needed. When creating a multi-location fleet, provide a list of additional remote locations.\n\nIf successful, this operation creates a new Fleet resource and places it in NEW status, which prompts GameLift to initiate the fleet creation workflow . You can track fleet creation by checking fleet status using DescribeFleetAttributes and DescribeFleetLocationAttributes /, or by monitoring fleet creation events using DescribeFleetEvents . As soon as the fleet status changes to ACTIVE , you can enable automatic scaling for the fleet with PutScalingPolicy and set capacity for the home Region with UpdateFleetCapacity . When the status of each remote location reaches ACTIVE , you can set capacity by location using UpdateFleetCapacity .\n\nLearn more\n\nSetting up fleets\n\nDebug fleet creation issues\n\nMulti-location fleets\n\nRelated actions\n\nCreateFleet | UpdateFleetCapacity | PutScalingPolicy | DescribeEC2InstanceLimits | DescribeFleetAttributes | DescribeFleetLocationAttributes | UpdateFleetAttributes | StopFleetActions | DeleteFleet | All APIs by task\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.\n\nSPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.\n\nON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group.

Whether your are using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting or as a standalone matchmaking service, the matchmaking configuration sets out rules for matching players and forming teams. If you’re also using GameLift hosting, it defines how to start game sessions for each match. Your matchmaking system can use multiple configurations to handle different game scenarios. All matchmaking requests ( StartMatchmaking or StartMatchBackfill ) identify the matchmaking configuration to use and provide player attributes consistent with that configuration.\n\nTo create a matchmaking configuration, you must provide the following: configuration name and FlexMatch mode (with or without GameLift hosting); a rule set that specifies how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; whether player acceptance is required; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt. When using FlexMatch with GameLift hosting, you also need to identify the game session queue to use when starting a game session for the match.\n\nIn addition, you must set up an Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) topic to receive matchmaking notifications. Provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration. An alternative method, continuously polling ticket status with DescribeMatchmaking , is only suitable for games in development with low matchmaking usage.\n\nLearn more\n\nDesign a FlexMatch matchmaker\n\nSet up FlexMatch event notification\n\nRelated actions\n\nCreateMatchmakingConfiguration | DescribeMatchmakingConfigurations | UpdateMatchmakingConfiguration | DeleteMatchmakingConfiguration | CreateMatchmakingRuleSet | DescribeMatchmakingRuleSets | ValidateMatchmakingRuleSet | DeleteMatchmakingRuleSet | All APIs by task\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see Instance Weighting in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide . Default value is “1”.\n\nBalancingStrategy -> (string)\n\nIndicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:\n\nSPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.\n\nSPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.\n\nON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.\n\nGameServerProtectionPolicy -> (string)\n\nA flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status.\n\nAutoScalingGroupArn -> (string)\n\nA generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is associated with this game server group.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nThe current status of the game server group. Possible statuses include:\n\nNEW - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the CreateGameServerGroup() request.\n\nACTIVATING - GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a game server group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account.\n\nACTIVE - The game server group has been successfully created.\n\nDELETE_SCHEDULED - A request to delete the game server group has been received.\n\nDELETING - GameLift FleetIQ has received a valid DeleteGameServerGroup() request and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ must first complete and release hosts before it deletes the Auto Scaling group and the game server group.\n\nDELETED - The game server group has been successfully deleted.\n\nERROR - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a game server group has failed, resulting in an error state.\n\nStatusReason -> (string)\n\nAdditional information about the current game server group status. This information might provide additional insight on groups that are in ERROR status.\n\nSuspendedActions -> (list)\n\nA list of activities that are currently suspended for this game server group. If this property is empty, all activities are occurring.\n\n(string)\n\nCreationTime -> (timestamp)\n\nA time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example \"1469498468.057\" ).\n\nLastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)\n\nA timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last updated."

Event messaging includes the fleet ID.\n\nFLEET_STATE_DOWNLOADING – Fleet status changed from NEW to DOWNLOADING . The compressed build has started downloading to a fleet instance for installation.\n\nFLEET_BINARY_DOWNLOAD_FAILED – The build failed to download to the fleet instance.\n\nFLEET_CREATION_EXTRACTING_BUILD – The game server build was successfully downloaded to an instance, and the build files are now being extracted from the uploaded build and saved to an instance. Failure at this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage display a list of the files that are extracted and saved on the instance. Access the logs by using the URL in PreSignedLogUrl .\n\nFLEET_CREATION_RUNNING_INSTALLER – The game server build files were successfully extracted, and the GameLift is now running the build’s install script (if one is included). Failure in this stage prevents a fleet from moving to ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage list the installation steps and whether or not the install completed successfully. Access the logs by using the URL in PreSignedLogUrl .\n\nFLEET_CREATION_VALIDATING_RUNTIME_CONFIG – The build process was successful, and the GameLift is now verifying that the game server launch paths, which are specified in the fleet’s runtime configuration, exist. If any listed launch path exists, GameLift tries to launch a game server process and waits for the process to report ready. Failures in this stage prevent a fleet from moving to ACTIVE status. Logs for this stage list the launch paths in the runtime configuration and indicate whether each is found. Access the logs by using the URL in PreSignedLogUrl .\n\nFLEET_STATE_VALIDATING – Fleet status changed from DOWNLOADING to VALIDATING .\n\nFLEET_VALIDATION_LAUNCH_PATH_NOT_FOUND – Validation of the runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path does not exist on the instance.\n\nFLEET_STATE_BUILDING – Fleet status changed from VALIDATING to BUILDING .\n\nFLEET_VALIDATION_EXECUTABLE_RUNTIME_FAILURE – Validation of the runtime configuration failed because the executable specified in a launch path failed to run on the fleet instance.\n\nFLEET_STATE_ACTIVATING – Fleet status changed from BUILDING to ACTIVATING .\n\nFLEET_ACTIVATION_FAILED - The fleet failed to successfully complete one of the steps in the fleet activation process. This event code indicates that the game build was successfully downloaded to a fleet instance, built, and validated, but was not able to start a server process. Learn more at Debug Fleet Creation Issues\n\nFLEET_STATE_ACTIVE – The fleet’s status changed from ACTIVATING to ACTIVE . The fleet is now ready to host game sessions.\n\nVPC peering events:\n\nFLEET_VPC_PEERING_SUCCEEDED – A VPC peering connection has been established between the VPC for an GameLift fleet and a VPC in your AWS account.\n\nFLEET_VPC_PEERING_FAILED – A requested VPC peering connection has failed. Event details and status information (see DescribeVpcPeeringConnections ) provide additional detail. A common reason for peering failure is that the two VPCs have overlapping CIDR blocks of IPv4 addresses. To resolve this, change the CIDR block for the VPC in your AWS account. For more information on VPC peering failures, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/invalid-peering-configurations.html\n\nFLEET_VPC_PEERING_DELETED – A VPC peering connection has been successfully deleted.\n\nSpot instance events:\n\nINSTANCE_INTERRUPTED – A spot instance was interrupted by EC2 with a two-minute notification.\n\nOther fleet events:\n\nFLEET_SCALING_EVENT – A change was made to the fleet’s capacity settings (desired instances, minimum/maximum scaling limits). Event messaging includes the new capacity settings.\n\nFLEET_NEW_GAME_SESSION_PROTECTION_POLICY_UPDATED – A change was made to the fleet’s game session protection policy setting. Event messaging includes both the old and new policy setting.\n\nFLEET_DELETED – A request to delete a fleet was initiated.\n\nGENERIC_EVENT – An unspecified event has occurred.\n\nMessage -> (string)\n\nAdditional information related to the event.\n\nEventTime -> (timestamp)\n\nTime stamp indicating when this event occurred. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example \"1469498468.057\" ).\n\nPreSignedLogUrl -> (string)\n\nLocation of stored logs with additional detail that is related to the event. This is useful for debugging issues. The URL is valid for 15 minutes.

All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.\n\nInstanceType -> (string)\n\nAn EC2 instance type designation.\n\nWeightedCapacity -> (string)\n\nInstance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type’s cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see Instance Weighting in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide . Default value is “1”.\n\nBalancingStrategy -> (string)\n\nIndicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:\n\nSPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.\n\nSPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.\n\nON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.\n\nGameServerProtectionPolicy -> (string)\n\nA flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status.\n\nAutoScalingGroupArn -> (string)\n\nA generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is associated with this game server group.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nThe current status of the game server group. Possible statuses include:\n\nNEW - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the CreateGameServerGroup() request.\n\nACTIVATING - GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a game server group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account.\n\nACTIVE - The game server group has been successfully created.\n\nDELETE_SCHEDULED - A request to delete the game server group has been received.\n\nDELETING - GameLift FleetIQ has received a valid DeleteGameServerGroup() request and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ must first complete and release hosts before it deletes the Auto Scaling group and the game server group.\n\nDELETED - The game server group has been successfully deleted.\n\nERROR - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a game server group has failed, resulting in an error state.\n\nStatusReason -> (string)\n\nAdditional information about the current game server group status. This information might provide additional insight on groups that are in ERROR status.\n\nSuspendedActions -> (list)\n\nA list of activities that are currently suspended for this game server group. If this property is empty, all activities are occurring.\n\n(string)\n\nCreationTime -> (timestamp)\n\nA time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example \"1469498468.057\" ).\n\nLastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)\n\nA timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last updated."

      "command_description": "Description\n\nCreates or updates a scaling policy for a fleet. Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet’s hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet’s capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling.\n\nFleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.\n\nYou can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling StopFleetActions with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call StartFleetActions with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy–or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with DeleteScalingPolicy .\n\nLearn more about how to work with auto-scaling in Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling .\n\nTarget-based policy\n\nA target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet’s hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet’s buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target.\n\nFor example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet’s available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer.\n\nTo create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to “TargetBased”. Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a TargetConfiguration object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it’s successfully created. If the fleet’s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.\n\nRule-based policy\n\nA rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action.\n\nFor example, a policy may make the following statement: “If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%.”\n\nA policy’s rule statement has the following structure:\n\nIf [MetricName] is [ComparisonOperator] [Threshold] for [EvaluationPeriods] minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment] .\n\nTo implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:\n\nIf [PercentIdleInstances] is [GreaterThanThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes, then [PercentChangeInCapacity] to/by [10] .\n\nTo create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to “RuleBased”. Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they’re successfully created. If the fleet’s auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.\n\nRelated actions\n\nDescribeFleetCapacity | UpdateFleetCapacity | DescribeEC2InstanceLimits | PutScalingPolicy | DescribeScalingPolicies | DeleteScalingPolicy | StopFleetActions | StartFleetActions | All APIs by task\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

A search request can search only one fleet, but it can search all of a fleet’s locations.\n\nThis operation can be used in the following ways:\n\nTo search all game sessions that are currently running on all locations in a fleet, provide a fleet or alias ID. This approach returns game sessions in the fleet’s home Region and all remote locations that fit the search criteria.\n\nTo search all game sessions that are currently running on a specific fleet location, provide a fleet or alias ID and a location name. For location, you can specify a fleet’s home Region or any remote location.\n\nUse the pagination parameters to retrieve results as a set of sequential pages.\n\nIf successful, a GameSession object is returned for each game session that matches the request. Search finds game sessions that are in ACTIVE status only. To retrieve information on game sessions in other statuses, use DescribeGameSessions .\n\nYou can search or sort by the following game session attributes:\n\ngameSessionId – A unique identifier for the game session. You can use either a GameSessionId or GameSessionArn value.\n\ngameSessionName – Name assigned to a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession . Game session names do not need to be unique to a game session.\n\ngameSessionProperties – Custom data defined in a game session’s GameProperty parameter. GameProperty values are stored as key:value pairs; the filter expression must indicate the key and a string to search the data values for. For example, to search for game sessions with custom data containing the key:value pair “gameMode:brawl”, specify the following: gameSessionProperties.gameMode = \"brawl\" . All custom data values are searched as strings.\n\nmaximumSessions – Maximum number of player sessions allowed for a game session. This value is set when requesting a new game session with CreateGameSession or updating with UpdateGameSession .\n\ncreationTimeMillis – Value indicating when a game session was created. It is expressed in Unix time as milliseconds.\n\nplayerSessionCount – Number of players currently connected to a game session. This value changes rapidly as players join the session or drop out.\n\nhasAvailablePlayerSessions – Boolean value indicating whether a game session has reached its maximum number of players. It is highly recommended that all search requests include this filter attribute to optimize search performance and return only sessions that players can join.\n\nNote\n\nReturned values for playerSessionCount and hasAvailablePlayerSessions change quickly as players join sessions and others drop out. Results should be considered a snapshot in time. Be sure to refresh search results often, and handle sessions that fill up before a player can join.\n\nRelated actions\n\nCreateGameSession | DescribeGameSessions | DescribeGameSessionDetails | SearchGameSessions | UpdateGameSession | GetGameSessionLogUrl | StartGameSessionPlacement | DescribeGameSessionPlacement | StopGameSessionPlacement | All APIs by task\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.\n\nsearch-game-sessions is a paginated operation.

When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue’s destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out.\n\nA game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request.\n\nWhen placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue’s destinations are listed in preference order.\n\nAlternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant Regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the Region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a Region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each Region’s average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players.\n\nTo place a new game session request, specify the following:\n\nThe queue name and a set of game session properties and settings\n\nA unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request\n\n(Optional) A set of player data and a unique player ID for each player that you are joining to the new game session (player data is optional, but if you include it, you must also provide a unique ID for each player)\n\nLatency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players)\n\nIf successful, a new game session placement is created.\n\nTo track the status of a placement request, call DescribeGameSessionPlacement and check the request’s status. If the status is FULFILLED , a new game session has been created and a game session ARN and Region are referenced. If the placement request times out, you can resubmit the request or retry it with a different queue.\n\nRelated actions\n\nCreateGameSession | DescribeGameSessions | DescribeGameSessionDetails | SearchGameSessions | UpdateGameSession | GetGameSessionLogUrl | StartGameSessionPlacement | DescribeGameSessionPlacement | StopGameSessionPlacement | All APIs by task\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

The backfill match process is essentially identical to the process of forming new matches. Backfill requests use the same matchmaker that was used to make the original match, and they provide matchmaking data for all players currently in the game session. FlexMatch uses this information to select new players so that backfilled match continues to meet the original match requirements.\n\nWhen using FlexMatch with GameLift managed hosting, you can request a backfill match from a client service by calling this operation with a GameSession identifier. You also have the option of making backfill requests directly from your game server. In response to a request, FlexMatch creates player sessions for the new players, updates the GameSession resource, and sends updated matchmaking data to the game server. You can request a backfill match at any point after a game session is started. Each game session can have only one active backfill request at a time; a subsequent request automatically replaces the earlier request.\n\nWhen using FlexMatch as a standalone component, request a backfill match by calling this operation without a game session identifier. As with newly formed matches, matchmaking results are returned in a matchmaking event so that your game can update the game session that is being backfilled.\n\nTo request a backfill match, specify a unique ticket ID, the original matchmaking configuration, and matchmaking data for all current players in the game session being backfilled. Optionally, specify the GameSession ARN. If successful, a match backfill ticket is created and returned with status set to QUEUED.

With games that use GameLift managed hosting, this operation also triggers GameLift to find hosting resources and start a new game session for the new match. Each matchmaking request includes information on one or more players and specifies the FlexMatch matchmaker to use. When a request is for multiple players, FlexMatch attempts to build a match that includes all players in the request, placing them in the same team and finding additional players as needed to fill the match.\n\nTo start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include any player attributes that are required by the matchmaking configuration’s rule set. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to QUEUED .\n\nTrack matchmaking events to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches. Ticket status updates are tracked using event notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS), which is defined in the matchmaking configuration.\n\nLearn more\n\nAdd FlexMatch to a game client\n\nSet Up FlexMatch event notification\n\nHow GameLift FlexMatch works\n\nRelated actions\n\nStartMatchmaking | DescribeMatchmaking | StopMatchmaking | AcceptMatch | StartMatchBackfill | All APIs by task\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

All game server groups must have at least two instance types defined for it. GameLift FleetIQ periodically evaluates each defined instance type for viability. It then updates the Auto Scaling group with the list of viable instance types.\n\nInstanceType -> (string)\n\nAn EC2 instance type designation.\n\nWeightedCapacity -> (string)\n\nInstance weighting that indicates how much this instance type contributes to the total capacity of a game server group. Instance weights are used by GameLift FleetIQ to calculate the instance type’s cost per unit hour and better identify the most cost-effective options. For detailed information on weighting instance capacity, see Instance Weighting in the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling User Guide . Default value is “1”.\n\nBalancingStrategy -> (string)\n\nIndicates how GameLift FleetIQ balances the use of Spot Instances and On-Demand Instances in the game server group. Method options include the following:\n\nSPOT_ONLY - Only Spot Instances are used in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable or not viable for game hosting, the game server group provides no hosting capacity until Spot Instances can again be used. Until then, no new instances are started, and the existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are not replaced.\n\nSPOT_PREFERRED - (default value) Spot Instances are used whenever available in the game server group. If Spot Instances are unavailable, the game server group continues to provide hosting capacity by falling back to On-Demand Instances. Existing nonviable Spot Instances are terminated (after current gameplay ends) and are replaced with new On-Demand Instances.\n\nON_DEMAND_ONLY - Only On-Demand Instances are used in the game server group. No Spot Instances are used, even when available, while this balancing strategy is in force.\n\nGameServerProtectionPolicy -> (string)\n\nA flag that indicates whether instances in the game server group are protected from early termination. Unprotected instances that have active game servers running might be terminated during a scale-down event, causing players to be dropped from the game. Protected instances cannot be terminated while there are active game servers running except in the event of a forced game server group deletion (see ). An exception to this is with Spot Instances, which can be terminated by AWS regardless of protection status.\n\nAutoScalingGroupArn -> (string)\n\nA generated unique ID for the EC2 Auto Scaling group that is associated with this game server group.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nThe current status of the game server group. Possible statuses include:\n\nNEW - GameLift FleetIQ has validated the CreateGameServerGroup() request.\n\nACTIVATING - GameLift FleetIQ is setting up a game server group, which includes creating an Auto Scaling group in your AWS account.\n\nACTIVE - The game server group has been successfully created.\n\nDELETE_SCHEDULED - A request to delete the game server group has been received.\n\nDELETING - GameLift FleetIQ has received a valid DeleteGameServerGroup() request and is processing it. GameLift FleetIQ must first complete and release hosts before it deletes the Auto Scaling group and the game server group.\n\nDELETED - The game server group has been successfully deleted.\n\nERROR - The asynchronous processes of activating or deleting a game server group has failed, resulting in an error state.\n\nStatusReason -> (string)\n\nAdditional information about the current game server group status. This information might provide additional insight on groups that are in ERROR status.\n\nSuspendedActions -> (list)\n\nA list of activities that are currently suspended for this game server group. If this property is empty, all activities are occurring.\n\n(string)\n\nCreationTime -> (timestamp)\n\nA time stamp indicating when this data object was created. Format is a number expressed in Unix time as milliseconds (for example \"1469498468.057\" ).\n\nLastUpdatedTime -> (timestamp)\n\nA timestamp that indicates when this game server group was last updated."

      "command_description": "Description\n\nUpdates capacity settings for a fleet. For fleets with multiple locations, use this operation to manage capacity settings in each location individually. Fleet capacity determines the number of game sessions and players that can be hosted based on the fleet configuration. Use this operation to set the following fleet capacity properties:\n\nMinimum/maximum size: Set hard limits on fleet capacity. GameLift cannot set the fleet’s capacity to a value outside of this range, whether the capacity is changed manually or through automatic scaling.\n\nDesired capacity: Manually set the number of EC2 instances to be maintained in a fleet location. Before changing a fleet’s desired capacity, you may want to call DescribeEC2InstanceLimits to get the maximum capacity of the fleet’s EC2 instance type. Alternatively, consider using automatic scaling to adjust capacity based on player demand.\n\nThis operation can be used in the following ways:\n\nTo update capacity for a fleet’s home Region, or if the fleet has no remote locations, omit the Location parameter. The fleet must be in ACTIVE status.\n\nTo update capacity for a fleet’s remote location, include the Location parameter set to the location to be updated. The location must be in ACTIVE status.\n\nIf successful, capacity settings are updated immediately. In response a change in desired capacity, GameLift initiates steps to start new instances or terminate existing instances in the requested fleet location. This continues until the location’s active instance count matches the new desired instance count. You can track a fleet’s current capacity by calling DescribeFleetCapacity or DescribeFleetLocationCapacity . If the requested desired instance count is higher than the instance type’s limit, the LimitExceeded exception occurs.\n\nLearn more\n\nScaling fleet capacity\n\nRelated actions\n\nCreateFleetLocations | UpdateFleetAttributes | UpdateFleetCapacity | UpdateFleetPortSettings | UpdateRuntimeConfiguration | StopFleetActions | StartFleetActions | PutScalingPolicy | DeleteFleet | DeleteFleetLocations | DeleteScalingPolicy | All APIs by task\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",
