      "command_description": "Description\n\nCreates an Batch compute environment. You can create MANAGED or UNMANAGED compute environments. MANAGED compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or Fargate resources. UNMANAGED compute environments can only use EC2 resources.\n\nIn a managed compute environment, Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the launch template that you specify when you create the compute environment. Either, you can choose to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances. Or, you can use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.\n\nNote\n\nMulti-node parallel jobs aren’t supported on Spot Instances.\n\nIn an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have a lot of flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMIs. However, you must verify that each of your AMIs meet the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see container instance AMIs in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide . After you created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the DescribeComputeEnvironments operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that’s associated with it. Then, launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see Launching an Amazon ECS container instance in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .\n\nNote\n\nBatch doesn’t upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after the environment is created. For example, it doesn’t update the AMIs when a newer version of the Amazon ECS optimized AMI is available. Therefore, you’re responsible for managing the guest operating system (including its updates and security patches) and any additional application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. To use a new AMI for your Batch jobs, complete these steps:\n\nCreate a new compute environment with the new AMI.\n\nAdd the compute environment to an existing job queue.\n\nRemove the earlier compute environment from your job queue.\n\nDelete the earlier compute environment.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

Up to 128 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, hyphens, and underscores are allowed.\n\n--type (string)\n\nThe type of the compute environment: MANAGED or UNMANAGED . For more information, see Compute Environments in the Batch User Guide .\n\nPossible values:\n\nMANAGED\n\nUNMANAGED\n\n--state (string)\n\nThe state of the compute environment. If the state is ENABLED , then the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on queues.\n\nIf the state is ENABLED , then the Batch scheduler can attempt to place jobs from an associated job queue on the compute resources within the environment. If the compute environment is managed, then it can scale its instances out or in automatically, based on the job queue demand.\n\nIf the state is DISABLED , then the Batch scheduler doesn’t attempt to place jobs within the environment. Jobs in a STARTING or RUNNING state continue to progress normally. Managed compute environments in the DISABLED state don’t scale out. However, they scale in to minvCpus value after instances become idle.\n\nPossible values:\n\nENABLED\n\nDISABLED\n\n--compute-resources (structure)\n\nDetails about the compute resources managed by the compute environment. This parameter is required for managed compute environments. For more information, see Compute Environments in the Batch User Guide .\n\ntype -> (string)\n\nThe type of compute environment: EC2 , SPOT , FARGATE , or FARGATE_SPOT . For more information, see Compute Environments in the Batch User Guide .\n\nIf you choose SPOT , you must also specify an Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role with the spotIamFleetRole parameter. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role in the Batch User Guide .\n\nallocationStrategy -> (string)\n\nThe allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or Amazon EC2 service limits . For more information, see Allocation Strategies in the Batch User Guide .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nBEST_FIT (default)\n\nBatch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren’t available, Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren’t enough instances available, or if the user is reaching Amazon EC2 service limits then additional jobs aren’t run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with BEST_FIT then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified.\n\nBEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE\n\nBatch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren’t available, Batch will select new instance types.\n\nSPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED\n\nBatch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.\n\nWith both BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE and SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED strategies, Batch might need to go above maxvCpus to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds maxvCpus by more than a single instance.\n\nminvCpus -> (integer)\n\nThe minimum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even if the compute environment is DISABLED ).\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nmaxvCpus -> (integer)\n\nThe maximum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that a compute environment can reach.\n\nNote\n\nWith both BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE and SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED allocation strategies, Batch might need to exceed maxvCpus to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds maxvCpus by more than a single instance. For example, no more than a single instance from among those specified in your compute environment is allocated.\n\ndesiredvCpus -> (integer)\n\nThe desired number of Amazon EC2 vCPUS in the compute environment. Batch modifies this value between the minimum and maximum values, based on job queue demand.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\ninstanceTypes -> (list)\n\nThe instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, c5 or p3 ), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as c5.8xlarge ). You can also choose optimal to select instance types (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) that match the demand of your job queues.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nNote\n\nWhen you create a compute environment, the instance types that you select for the compute environment must share the same architecture. For example, you can’t mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environment.\n\nNote\n\nCurrently, optimal uses instance types from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families. In Regions that don’t have instance types from those instance families, instance types from the C5, M5. and R5 instance families are used.\n\n(string)\n\nimageId -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is overridden by the imageIdOverride member of the Ec2Configuration structure.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nNote\n\nThe AMI that you choose for a compute environment must match the architecture of the instance types that you intend to use for that compute environment. For example, if your compute environment uses A1 instance types, the compute resource AMI that you choose must support ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both x86 and ARM versions of the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more information, see Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .\n\nsubnets -> (list)\n\nThe VPC subnets where the compute resources are launched. These subnets must be within the same VPC. Fargate compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For more information, see VPCs and Subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide .\n\n(string)\n\nsecurityGroupIds -> (list)\n\nThe Amazon EC2 security groups associated with instances launched in the compute environment. One or more security groups must be specified, either in securityGroupIds or using a launch template referenced in launchTemplate . This parameter is required for jobs that are running on Fargate resources and must contain at least one security group. Fargate doesn’t support launch templates. If security groups are specified using both securityGroupIds and launchTemplate , the values in securityGroupIds are used.\n\n(string)\n\nec2KeyPair -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon EC2 key pair that’s used for instances launched in the compute environment. You can use this key pair to log in to your instances with SSH.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\ninstanceRole -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, `` ecsInstanceRole `` or ``arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id> :instance-profile/ecsInstanceRole `` . For more information, see Amazon ECS Instance Role in the Batch User Guide .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\ntags -> (map)\n\nKey-value pair tags to be applied to EC2 resources that are launched in the compute environment. For Batch, these take the form of “String1”: “String2”, where String1 is the tag key and String2 is the tag value−for example, { \"Name\": \"Batch Instance - C4OnDemand\" } . This is helpful for recognizing your Batch instances in the Amazon EC2 console. These tags can’t be updated or removed after the compute environment is created.Aany changes to these tags require that you create a new compute environment and remove the old compute environment. These tags aren’t seen when using the Batch ListTagsForResource API operation.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nplacementGroup -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. If you intend to submit multi-node parallel jobs to your compute environment, you should consider creating a cluster placement group and associate it with your compute resources. This keeps your multi-node parallel job on a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone with high network flow potential. For more information, see Placement Groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nbidPercentage -> (integer)\n\nThe maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be less than 20% of the current On-Demand price for that Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nspotIamFleetRole -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a SPOT compute environment. This role is required if the allocation strategy set to BEST_FIT or if the allocation strategy isn’t specified. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet Role in the Batch User Guide .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nWarning\n\nTo tag your Spot Instances on creation, the Spot Fleet IAM role specified here must use the newer AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole managed policy. The previously recommended AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole managed policy doesn’t have the required permissions to tag Spot Instances. For more information, see Spot Instances not tagged on creation in the Batch User Guide .\n\nlaunchTemplate -> (structure)\n\nThe launch template to use for your compute resources. Any other compute resource parameters that you specify in a CreateComputeEnvironment API operation override the same parameters in the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both. For more information, see Launch Template Support in the Batch User Guide .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nlaunchTemplateId -> (string)\n\nThe ID of the launch template.\n\nlaunchTemplateName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the launch template.\n\nversion -> (string)\n\nThe version number of the launch template, $Latest , or $Default .\n\nIf the value is $Latest , the latest version of the launch template is used. If the value is $Default , the default version of the launch template is used.\n\nWarning\n\nAfter the compute environment is created, the launch template version that’s used isn’t changed, even if the $Default or $Latest version for the launch template is updated. To use a new launch template version, create a new compute environment, add the new compute environment to the existing job queue, remove the old compute environment from the job queue, and delete the old compute environment.\n\nDefault: $Default .\n\nec2Configuration -> (list)\n\nProvides information used to select Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for EC2 instances in the compute environment. If Ec2Configuration isn’t specified, the default is ECS_AL1 .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\n(structure)\n\nProvides information used to select Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for instances in the compute environment. If Ec2Configuration isn’t specified, the default is currently ECS_AL1 (Amazon Linux ) for non-GPU, non AWSGraviton instances. Starting on March 31, 2021, this default will be changing to ECS_AL2 (Amazon Linux 2 ).\n\nNote\n\nThis object isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources.\n\nimageType -> (string)\n\nThe image type to match with the instance type to select an AMI. If the imageIdOverride parameter isn’t specified, then a recent Amazon ECS-optimized AMI (ECS_AL1 ) is used. Starting on March 31, 2021, this default will be changing to ECS_AL2 (Amazon Linux 2 ).\n\nECS_AL2\n\nAmazon Linux 2 − Default for all Amazon Web Services Graviton-based instance families (for example, C6g , M6g , R6g , and T4g ) and can be used for all non-GPU instance types.\n\nECS_AL2_NVIDIA\n\nAmazon Linux 2 (GPU) −Default for all GPU instance families (for example P4 and G4 ) and can be used for all non Amazon Web Services Graviton-based instance types.\n\nECS_AL1\n\nAmazon Linux −Default for all non-GPU, non Amazon Web Services Graviton instance families. Amazon Linux is reaching the end-of-life of standard support. For more information, see Amazon Linux AMI .\n\nimageIdOverride -> (string)\n\nThe AMI ID used for instances launched in the compute environment that match the image type. This setting overrides the imageId set in the computeResource object.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\ntype=string,allocationStrategy=string,minvCpus=integer,maxvCpus=integer,desiredvCpus=integer,instanceTypes=string,string,imageId=string,subnets=string,string,securityGroupIds=string,string,ec2KeyPair=string,instanceRole=string,tags={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string},placementGroup=string,bidPercentage=integer,spotIamFleetRole=string,launchTemplate={launchTemplateId=string,launchTemplateName=string,version=string},ec2Configuration=[{imageType=string,imageIdOverride=string},{imageType=string,imageIdOverride=string}]\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"EC2\"|\"SPOT\"|\"FARGATE\"|\"FARGATE_SPOT\",\n  \"allocationStrategy\": \"BEST_FIT\"|\"BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE\"|\"SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED\",\n  \"minvCpus\": integer,\n  \"maxvCpus\": integer,\n  \"desiredvCpus\": integer,\n  \"instanceTypes\": [\"string\", ...],\n  \"imageId\": \"string\",\n  \"subnets\": [\"string\", ...],\n  \"securityGroupIds\": [\"string\", ...],\n  \"ec2KeyPair\": \"string\",\n  \"instanceRole\": \"string\",\n  \"tags\": {\"string\": \"string\"\n    ...},\n  \"placementGroup\": \"string\",\n  \"bidPercentage\": integer,\n  \"spotIamFleetRole\": \"string\",\n  \"launchTemplate\": {\n    \"launchTemplateId\": \"string\",\n    \"launchTemplateName\": \"string\",\n    \"version\": \"string\"\n  },\n  \"ec2Configuration\": [\n    {\n      \"imageType\": \"string\",\n      \"imageIdOverride\": \"string\"\n    }\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\n\n--service-role (string)\n\nThe full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows Batch to make calls to other Amazon Web Services services on your behalf. For more information, see Batch service IAM role in the Batch User Guide .\n\nWarning\n\nIf your account already created the Batch service-linked role, that role is used by default for your compute environment unless you specify a different role here. If the Batch service-linked role doesn’t exist in your account, and no role is specified here, the service attempts to create the Batch service-linked role in your account.\n\nIf your specified role has a path other than / , then you must specify either the full role ARN (recommended) or prefix the role name with the path. For example, if a role with the name bar has a path of /foo/ then you would specify /foo/bar as the role name. For more information, see Friendly names and paths in the IAM User Guide .\n\nNote\n\nDepending on how you created your Batch service role, its ARN might contain the service-role path prefix. When you only specify the name of the service role, Batch assumes that your ARN doesn’t use the service-role path prefix. Because of this, we recommend that you specify the full ARN of your service role when you create compute environments.\n\n--tags (map)\n\nThe tags that you apply to the compute environment to help you categorize and organize your resources. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. For more information, see Tagging Amazon Web Services Resources in Amazon Web Services General Reference .\n\nThese tags can be updated or removed using the TagResource and UntagResource API operations. These tags don’t propagate to the underlying compute resources.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nKeyName1=string,KeyName2=string\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\"string\": \"string\"\n  ...}\n\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.

Job queues with a higher priority (or a higher integer value for the priority parameter) are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment. Priority is determined in descending order. For example, a job queue with a priority value of 10 is given scheduling preference over a job queue with a priority value of 1 . All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can’t be mixed.\n\n--compute-environment-order (list)\n\nThe set of compute environments mapped to a job queue and their order relative to each other. The job scheduler uses this parameter to determine which compute environment should run a specific job. Compute environments must be in the VALID state before you can associate them with a job queue. You can associate up to three compute environments with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can’t be mixed.\n\nNote\n\nAll compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. Batch doesn’t support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe order in which compute environments are tried for job placement within a queue. Compute environments are tried in ascending order. For example, if two compute environments are associated with a job queue, the compute environment with a lower order integer value is tried for job placement first. Compute environments must be in the VALID state before you can associate them with a job queue. All of the compute environments must be either EC2 (EC2 or SPOT ) or Fargate (FARGATE or FARGATE_SPOT ); EC2 and Fargate compute environments can’t be mixed.\n\nNote\n\nAll compute environments that are associated with a job queue must share the same architecture. Batch doesn’t support mixing compute environment architecture types in a single job queue.\n\norder -> (integer)\n\nThe order of the compute environment.

However, they scale in to minvCpus value after instances become idle.\n\nstatus -> (string)\n\nThe current status of the compute environment (for example, CREATING or VALID ).\n\nstatusReason -> (string)\n\nA short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status of the compute environment.\n\ncomputeResources -> (structure)\n\nThe compute resources defined for the compute environment. For more information, see Compute Environments in the Batch User Guide .\n\ntype -> (string)\n\nThe type of compute environment: EC2 , SPOT , FARGATE , or FARGATE_SPOT . For more information, see Compute Environments in the Batch User Guide .\n\nIf you choose SPOT , you must also specify an Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role with the spotIamFleetRole parameter. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet role in the Batch User Guide .\n\nallocationStrategy -> (string)\n\nThe allocation strategy to use for the compute resource if not enough instances of the best fitting instance type can be allocated. This might be because of availability of the instance type in the Region or Amazon EC2 service limits . For more information, see Allocation Strategies in the Batch User Guide .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nBEST_FIT (default)\n\nBatch selects an instance type that best fits the needs of the jobs with a preference for the lowest-cost instance type. If additional instances of the selected instance type aren’t available, Batch waits for the additional instances to be available. If there aren’t enough instances available, or if the user is reaching Amazon EC2 service limits then additional jobs aren’t run until the currently running jobs have completed. This allocation strategy keeps costs lower but can limit scaling. If you are using Spot Fleets with BEST_FIT then the Spot Fleet IAM Role must be specified.\n\nBEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE\n\nBatch will select additional instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types with a lower cost per unit vCPU. If additional instances of the previously selected instance types aren’t available, Batch will select new instance types.\n\nSPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED\n\nBatch will select one or more instance types that are large enough to meet the requirements of the jobs in the queue, with a preference for instance types that are less likely to be interrupted. This allocation strategy is only available for Spot Instance compute resources.\n\nWith both BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE and SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED strategies, Batch might need to go above maxvCpus to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds maxvCpus by more than a single instance.\n\nminvCpus -> (integer)\n\nThe minimum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that an environment should maintain (even if the compute environment is DISABLED ).\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nmaxvCpus -> (integer)\n\nThe maximum number of Amazon EC2 vCPUs that a compute environment can reach.\n\nNote\n\nWith both BEST_FIT_PROGRESSIVE and SPOT_CAPACITY_OPTIMIZED allocation strategies, Batch might need to exceed maxvCpus to meet your capacity requirements. In this event, Batch never exceeds maxvCpus by more than a single instance. For example, no more than a single instance from among those specified in your compute environment is allocated.\n\ndesiredvCpus -> (integer)\n\nThe desired number of Amazon EC2 vCPUS in the compute environment. Batch modifies this value between the minimum and maximum values, based on job queue demand.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\ninstanceTypes -> (list)\n\nThe instances types that can be launched. You can specify instance families to launch any instance type within those families (for example, c5 or p3 ), or you can specify specific sizes within a family (such as c5.8xlarge ). You can also choose optimal to select instance types (from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families) that match the demand of your job queues.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nNote\n\nWhen you create a compute environment, the instance types that you select for the compute environment must share the same architecture. For example, you can’t mix x86 and ARM instances in the same compute environment.\n\nNote\n\nCurrently, optimal uses instance types from the C4, M4, and R4 instance families. In Regions that don’t have instance types from those instance families, instance types from the C5, M5. and R5 instance families are used.\n\n(string)\n\nimageId -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ID used for instances launched in the compute environment. This parameter is overridden by the imageIdOverride member of the Ec2Configuration structure.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nNote\n\nThe AMI that you choose for a compute environment must match the architecture of the instance types that you intend to use for that compute environment. For example, if your compute environment uses A1 instance types, the compute resource AMI that you choose must support ARM instances. Amazon ECS vends both x86 and ARM versions of the Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI. For more information, see Amazon ECS-optimized Amazon Linux 2 AMI in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .\n\nsubnets -> (list)\n\nThe VPC subnets where the compute resources are launched. These subnets must be within the same VPC. Fargate compute resources can contain up to 16 subnets. For more information, see VPCs and Subnets in the Amazon VPC User Guide .\n\n(string)\n\nsecurityGroupIds -> (list)\n\nThe Amazon EC2 security groups associated with instances launched in the compute environment. One or more security groups must be specified, either in securityGroupIds or using a launch template referenced in launchTemplate . This parameter is required for jobs that are running on Fargate resources and must contain at least one security group. Fargate doesn’t support launch templates. If security groups are specified using both securityGroupIds and launchTemplate , the values in securityGroupIds are used.\n\n(string)\n\nec2KeyPair -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon EC2 key pair that’s used for instances launched in the compute environment. You can use this key pair to log in to your instances with SSH.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\ninstanceRole -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon ECS instance profile applied to Amazon EC2 instances in a compute environment. You can specify the short name or full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an instance profile. For example, `` ecsInstanceRole `` or ``arn:aws:iam::<aws_account_id> :instance-profile/ecsInstanceRole `` . For more information, see Amazon ECS Instance Role in the Batch User Guide .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\ntags -> (map)\n\nKey-value pair tags to be applied to EC2 resources that are launched in the compute environment. For Batch, these take the form of “String1”: “String2”, where String1 is the tag key and String2 is the tag value−for example, { \"Name\": \"Batch Instance - C4OnDemand\" } . This is helpful for recognizing your Batch instances in the Amazon EC2 console. These tags can’t be updated or removed after the compute environment is created.Aany changes to these tags require that you create a new compute environment and remove the old compute environment. These tags aren’t seen when using the Batch ListTagsForResource API operation.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nplacementGroup -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon EC2 placement group to associate with your compute resources. If you intend to submit multi-node parallel jobs to your compute environment, you should consider creating a cluster placement group and associate it with your compute resources. This keeps your multi-node parallel job on a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone with high network flow potential. For more information, see Placement Groups in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nbidPercentage -> (integer)\n\nThe maximum percentage that a Spot Instance price can be when compared with the On-Demand price for that instance type before instances are launched. For example, if your maximum percentage is 20%, then the Spot price must be less than 20% of the current On-Demand price for that Amazon EC2 instance. You always pay the lowest (market) price and never more than your maximum percentage. If you leave this field empty, the default value is 100% of the On-Demand price.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nspotIamFleetRole -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet IAM role applied to a SPOT compute environment. This role is required if the allocation strategy set to BEST_FIT or if the allocation strategy isn’t specified. For more information, see Amazon EC2 Spot Fleet Role in the Batch User Guide .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nWarning\n\nTo tag your Spot Instances on creation, the Spot Fleet IAM role specified here must use the newer AmazonEC2SpotFleetTaggingRole managed policy. The previously recommended AmazonEC2SpotFleetRole managed policy doesn’t have the required permissions to tag Spot Instances. For more information, see Spot Instances not tagged on creation in the Batch User Guide .\n\nlaunchTemplate -> (structure)\n\nThe launch template to use for your compute resources. Any other compute resource parameters that you specify in a CreateComputeEnvironment API operation override the same parameters in the launch template. You must specify either the launch template ID or launch template name in the request, but not both. For more information, see Launch Template Support in the Batch User Guide .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\nlaunchTemplateId -> (string)\n\nThe ID of the launch template.\n\nlaunchTemplateName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the launch template.\n\nversion -> (string)\n\nThe version number of the launch template, $Latest , or $Default .\n\nIf the value is $Latest , the latest version of the launch template is used. If the value is $Default , the default version of the launch template is used.\n\nWarning\n\nAfter the compute environment is created, the launch template version that’s used isn’t changed, even if the $Default or $Latest version for the launch template is updated. To use a new launch template version, create a new compute environment, add the new compute environment to the existing job queue, remove the old compute environment from the job queue, and delete the old compute environment.\n\nDefault: $Default .\n\nec2Configuration -> (list)\n\nProvides information used to select Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for EC2 instances in the compute environment. If Ec2Configuration isn’t specified, the default is ECS_AL1 .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources, and shouldn’t be specified.\n\n(structure)\n\nProvides information used to select Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for instances in the compute environment. If Ec2Configuration isn’t specified, the default is currently ECS_AL1 (Amazon Linux ) for non-GPU, non AWSGraviton instances.

This parameter is translated to the --memory-swap option to docker run where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the maxSwap value. For more information, see ` --memory-swap details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#–memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.\n\nIf a maxSwap value of 0 is specified, the container doesn’t use swap. Accepted values are 0 or any positive integer. If the maxSwap parameter is omitted, the container doesn’t use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A maxSwap value must be set for the swappiness parameter to be used.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nswappiness -> (integer)\n\nThis allows you to tune a container’s memory swappiness behavior. A swappiness value of 0 causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A swappiness value of 100 causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between 0 and 100 . If the swappiness parameter isn’t specified, a default value of 60 is used. If a value isn’t specified for maxSwap , then this parameter is ignored. If maxSwap is set to 0, the container doesn’t use swap. This parameter maps to the --memory-swappiness option to docker run .\n\nConsider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.\n\nSwap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use.\n\nNote\n\nThe Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don’t have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see Instance Store Swap Volumes in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances or How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file?\n\nThe swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources.\n\nIf the maxSwap and swappiness parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default swappiness value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nlogConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe log configuration specification for the container.\n\nThis parameter maps to LogConfig in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --log-driver option to docker run . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.\n\nNote\n\nBatch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the LogConfiguration data type).\n\nThis parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep \"Server API version\"\n\nNote\n\nThe Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options.

A range of 0:3 indicates nodes with index values of 0 through 3 . If the starting range value is omitted (:n ), then 0 is used to start the range. If the ending range value is omitted (n: ), then the highest possible node index is used to end the range. Your accumulative node ranges must account for all nodes (0:n ). You can nest node ranges, for example 0:10 and 4:5 , in which case the 4:5 range properties override the 0:10 properties.\n\ncontainer -> (structure)\n\nThe container details for the node range.\n\nimage -> (string)\n\nThe image used to start a container. This string is passed directly to the Docker daemon. Images in the Docker Hub registry are available by default. Other repositories are specified with `` repository-url /image :tag `` .

This parameter maps to the --tmpfs option to docker run .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe container path, mount options, and size of the tmpfs mount.\n\nNote\n\nThis object isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources.\n\ncontainerPath -> (string)\n\nThe absolute file path in the container where the tmpfs volume is mounted.\n\nsize -> (integer)\n\nThe size (in MiB) of the tmpfs volume.\n\nmountOptions -> (list)\n\nThe list of tmpfs volume mount options.\n\nValid values: “defaults ” | “ro ” | “rw ” | “suid ” | “nosuid ” | “dev ” | “nodev ” | “exec ” | “noexec ” | “sync ” | “async ” | “dirsync ” | “remount ” | “mand ” | “nomand ” | “atime ” | “noatime ” | “diratime ” | “nodiratime ” | “bind ” | “rbind\" | \"unbindable\" | \"runbindable\" | \"private\" | \"rprivate\" | \"shared\" | \"rshared\" | \"slave\" | \"rslave\" | \"relatime ” | “norelatime ” | “strictatime ” | “nostrictatime ” | “mode ” | “uid ” | “gid ” | “nr_inodes ” | “nr_blocks ” | “mpol “\n\n(string)\n\nmaxSwap -> (integer)\n\nThe total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This parameter is translated to the --memory-swap option to docker run where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the maxSwap value. For more information, see ` --memory-swap details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#–memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.\n\nIf a maxSwap value of 0 is specified, the container doesn’t use swap. Accepted values are 0 or any positive integer. If the maxSwap parameter is omitted, the container doesn’t use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A maxSwap value must be set for the swappiness parameter to be used.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nswappiness -> (integer)\n\nThis allows you to tune a container’s memory swappiness behavior. A swappiness value of 0 causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A swappiness value of 100 causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between 0 and 100 . If the swappiness parameter isn’t specified, a default value of 60 is used. If a value isn’t specified for maxSwap , then this parameter is ignored. If maxSwap is set to 0, the container doesn’t use swap. This parameter maps to the --memory-swappiness option to docker run .\n\nConsider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.\n\nSwap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use.\n\nNote\n\nThe Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don’t have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see Instance Store Swap Volumes in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances or How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file?\n\nThe swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources.\n\nIf the maxSwap and swappiness parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default swappiness value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nlogConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe log configuration specification for the container.\n\nThis parameter maps to LogConfig in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --log-driver option to docker run . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.\n\nNote\n\nBatch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the LogConfiguration data type).\n\nThis parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep \"Server API version\"\n\nNote\n\nThe Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .\n\nlogDriver -> (string)\n\nThe log driver to use for the container. The valid values listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by default.\n\nThe supported log drivers are awslogs , fluentd , gelf , json-file , journald , logentries , syslog , and splunk .\n\nNote\n\nJobs that are running on Fargate resources are restricted to the awslogs and splunk log drivers.\n\nawslogs\n\nSpecifies the Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver. For more information, see Using the awslogs Log Driver in the Batch User Guide and Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\nfluentd\n\nSpecifies the Fluentd logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Fluentd logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\ngelf\n\nSpecifies the Graylog Extended Format (GELF) logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Graylog Extended Format logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\njournald\n\nSpecifies the journald logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Journald logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\njson-file\n\nSpecifies the JSON file logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see JSON File logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\nsplunk\n\nSpecifies the Splunk logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Splunk logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\nsyslog\n\nSpecifies the syslog logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Syslog logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\nNote\n\nIf you have a custom driver that’s not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that’s available on GitHub and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn’t currently support running modified copies of this software.\n\nThis parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep \"Server API version\"\n\noptions -> (map)\n\nThe configuration options to send to the log driver. This parameter requires version 1.19 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep \"Server API version\"\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nsecretOptions -> (list)\n\nThe secrets to pass to the log configuration. For more information, see Specifying Sensitive Data in the Batch User Guide .\n\n(structure)\n\nAn object representing the secret to expose to your container. Secrets can be exposed to a container in the following ways:\n\nTo inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables, use the secrets container definition parameter.\n\nTo reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container, use the secretOptions container definition parameter.\n\nFor more information, see Specifying sensitive data in the Batch User Guide .\n\nname -> (string)\n\nThe name of the secret.\n\nvalueFrom -> (string)\n\nThe secret to expose to the container. The supported values are either the full ARN of the Secrets Manager secret or the full ARN of the parameter in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store.\n\nNote\n\nIf the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the job you’re launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.\n\nsecrets -> (list)\n\nThe secrets for the container. For more information, see Specifying sensitive data in the Batch User Guide .\n\n(structure)\n\nAn object representing the secret to expose to your container. Secrets can be exposed to a container in the following ways:\n\nTo inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables, use the secrets container definition parameter.\n\nTo reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container, use the secretOptions container definition parameter.\n\nFor more information, see Specifying sensitive data in the Batch User Guide .\n\nname -> (string)\n\nThe name of the secret.\n\nvalueFrom -> (string)\n\nThe secret to expose to the container. The supported values are either the full ARN of the Secrets Manager secret or the full ARN of the parameter in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store.\n\nNote\n\nIf the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the job you’re launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.\n\nnetworkConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe network configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.\n\nassignPublicIp -> (string)\n\nIndicates whether the job should have a public IP address. For a job that is running on Fargate resources in a private subnet to send outbound traffic to the internet (for example, to pull container images), the private subnet requires a NAT gateway be attached to route requests to the internet. For more information, see Amazon ECS task networking . The default value is “DISABLED”.\n\nfargatePlatformConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe platform configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.\n\nplatformVersion -> (string)\n\nThe Fargate platform version where the jobs are running. A platform version is specified only for jobs that are running on Fargate resources. If one isn’t specified, the LATEST platform version is used by default. This uses a recent, approved version of the Fargate platform for compute resources. For more information, see Fargate platform versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .\n\ntags -> (map)\n\nThe tags applied to the job definition.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\npropagateTags -> (boolean)\n\nSpecifies whether to propagate the tags from the job or job definition to the corresponding Amazon ECS task. If no value is specified, the tags aren’t propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the FAILED state.\n\nplatformCapabilities -> (list)\n\nThe platform capabilities required by the job definition. If no value is specified, it defaults to EC2 . Jobs run on Fargate resources specify FARGATE .\n\n(string)\n\nnextToken -> (string)\n\nThe nextToken value to include in a future DescribeJobDefinitions request. When the results of a DescribeJobDefinitions request exceed maxResults , this value can be used to retrieve the next page of results. This value is null when there are no more results to return.",

By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However, the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance. Or, alternatively, it must be configured on a different log server for remote logging options. For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.\n\nNote\n\nBatch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the LogConfiguration data type).

This parameter is translated to the --memory-swap option to docker run where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the maxSwap value. For more information, see ` --memory-swap details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#–memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.\n\nIf a maxSwap value of 0 is specified, the container doesn’t use swap. Accepted values are 0 or any positive integer. If the maxSwap parameter is omitted, the container doesn’t use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A maxSwap value must be set for the swappiness parameter to be used.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nswappiness -> (integer)\n\nThis allows you to tune a container’s memory swappiness behavior. A swappiness value of 0 causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A swappiness value of 100 causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between 0 and 100 . If the swappiness parameter isn’t specified, a default value of 60 is used.

By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options).

Specifying an array job ID with this parameter lists all child jobs from within the specified array.\n\n--multi-node-job-id (string)\n\nThe job ID for a multi-node parallel job. Specifying a multi-node parallel job ID with this parameter lists all nodes that are associated with the specified job.\n\n--job-status (string)\n\nThe job status used to filter jobs in the specified queue. If the filters parameter is specified, the jobStatus parameter is ignored and jobs with any status are returned. If you don’t specify a status, only RUNNING jobs are returned.\n\nPossible values:\n\nSUBMITTED\n\nPENDING\n\nRUNNABLE\n\nSTARTING\n\nRUNNING\n\nSUCCEEDED\n\nFAILED\n\n--filters (list)\n\nThe filter to apply to the query. Only one filter can be used at a time. When the filter is used, jobStatus is ignored. The filter doesn’t apply to child jobs in an array or multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. The results are sorted by the createdAt field, with the most recent jobs being first.\n\nJOB_NAME\n\nThe value of the filter is a case-insensitive match for the job name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter will match any job name that begins with the string before the ‘*’. This corresponds to the jobName value. For example, test1 matches both Test1 and test1 , and test1* matches both test1 and Test10 . When the JOB_NAME filter is used, the results are grouped by the job name and version.\n\nJOB_DEFINITION\n\nThe value for the filter is the name or Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the job definition. This corresponds to the jobDefinition value. The value is case sensitive. When the value for the filter is the job definition name, the results include all the jobs that used any revision of that job definition name. If the value ends with an asterisk (*), the filter will match any job definition name that begins with the string before the ‘*’. For example, jd1 matches only jd1 , and jd1* matches both jd1 and jd1A . The version of the job definition that’s used doesn’t affect the sort order. When the JOB_DEFINITION filter is used and the ARN is used (which is in the form arn:${Partition}:batch:${Region}:${Account}:job-definition/${JobDefinitionName}:${Revision} ), the results include jobs that used the specified revision of the job definition. Asterisk (*) is not supported when the ARN is used.\n\nBEFORE_CREATED_AT\n\nThe value for the filter is the time that’s before the job was created. This corresponds to the createdAt value. The value is a string representation of the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.\n\nAFTER_CREATED_AT\n\nThe value for the filter is the time that’s after the job was created. This corresponds to the createdAt value. The value is a string representation of the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC (midnight) on January 1, 1970.\n\n(structure)\n\nA filter name and value pair that’s used to return a more specific list of results from a ListJobs API operation.\n\nname -> (string)\n\nThe name of the filter.

It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--starting-token (string)\n\nA token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--page-size (integer)\n\nThe size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command’s output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--max-items (integer)\n\nThe total number of items to return in the command’s output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command’s output. To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json.

The supported values are 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4\n\nvalue = 0.25\n\nMEMORY = 512, 1024, or 2048\n\nvalue = 0.5\n\nMEMORY = 1024, 2048, 3072, or 4096\n\nvalue = 1\n\nMEMORY = 2048, 3072, 4096, 5120, 6144, 7168, or 8192\n\nvalue = 2\n\nMEMORY = 4096, 5120, 6144, 7168, 8192, 9216, 10240, 11264, 12288, 13312, 14336, 15360, or 16384\n\nvalue = 4\n\nMEMORY = 8192, 9216, 10240, 11264, 12288, 13312, 14336, 15360, 16384, 17408, 18432, 19456, 20480, 21504, 22528, 23552, 24576, 25600, 26624, 27648, 28672, 29696, or 30720\n\ntype -> (string)\n\nThe type of resource to assign to a container. The supported resources include GPU , MEMORY , and VCPU .\n\nlinuxParameters -> (structure)\n\nLinux-specific modifications that are applied to the container, such as details for device mappings.\n\ndevices -> (list)\n\nAny host devices to expose to the container. This parameter maps to Devices in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --device option to docker run .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\n(structure)\n\nAn object representing a container instance host device.\n\nNote\n\nThis object isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nhostPath -> (string)\n\nThe path for the device on the host container instance.\n\ncontainerPath -> (string)\n\nThe path inside the container that’s used to expose the host device. By default, the hostPath value is used.\n\npermissions -> (list)\n\nThe explicit permissions to provide to the container for the device. By default, the container has permissions for read , write , and mknod for the device.\n\n(string)\n\ninitProcessEnabled -> (boolean)\n\nIf true, run an init process inside the container that forwards signals and reaps processes. This parameter maps to the --init option to docker run . This parameter requires version 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep \"Server API version\"\n\nsharedMemorySize -> (integer)\n\nThe value for the size (in MiB) of the /dev/shm volume. This parameter maps to the --shm-size option to docker run .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\ntmpfs -> (list)\n\nThe container path, mount options, and size (in MiB) of the tmpfs mount.

This parameter is translated to the --memory-swap option to docker run where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the maxSwap value. For more information, see ` --memory-swap details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#–memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.\n\nIf a maxSwap value of 0 is specified, the container doesn’t use swap. Accepted values are 0 or any positive integer. If the maxSwap parameter is omitted, the container doesn’t use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A maxSwap value must be set for the swappiness parameter to be used.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nswappiness -> (integer)\n\nThis allows you to tune a container’s memory swappiness behavior. A swappiness value of 0 causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A swappiness value of 100 causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between 0 and 100 . If the swappiness parameter isn’t specified, a default value of 60 is used. If a value isn’t specified for maxSwap , then this parameter is ignored. If maxSwap is set to 0, the container doesn’t use swap. This parameter maps to the --memory-swappiness option to docker run .\n\nConsider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.\n\nSwap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use.\n\nNote\n\nThe Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don’t have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see Instance Store Swap Volumes in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances or How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file?\n\nThe swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources.\n\nIf the maxSwap and swappiness parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default swappiness value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nlogConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe log configuration specification for the container.\n\nThis parameter maps to LogConfig in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --log-driver option to docker run . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.\n\nNote\n\nBatch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the LogConfiguration data type).\n\nThis parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep \"Server API version\"\n\nNote\n\nThe Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .\n\nlogDriver -> (string)\n\nThe log driver to use for the container. The valid values listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by default.\n\nThe supported log drivers are awslogs , fluentd , gelf , json-file , journald , logentries , syslog , and splunk .\n\nNote\n\nJobs that are running on Fargate resources are restricted to the awslogs and splunk log drivers.\n\nawslogs\n\nSpecifies the Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver. For more information, see Using the awslogs Log Driver in the Batch User Guide and Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\nfluentd\n\nSpecifies the Fluentd logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Fluentd logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\ngelf\n\nSpecifies the Graylog Extended Format (GELF) logging driver.

For more information, including usage and options, see Splunk logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\nsyslog\n\nSpecifies the syslog logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Syslog logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\nNote\n\nIf you have a custom driver that’s not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that’s available on GitHub and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn’t currently support running modified copies of this software.\n\nThis parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance.

Secrets can be exposed to a container in the following ways:\n\nTo inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables, use the secrets container definition parameter.\n\nTo reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container, use the secretOptions container definition parameter.\n\nFor more information, see Specifying sensitive data in the Batch User Guide .\n\nname -> (string)\n\nThe name of the secret.\n\nvalueFrom -> (string)\n\nThe secret to expose to the container. The supported values are either the full ARN of the Secrets Manager secret or the full ARN of the parameter in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store.\n\nNote\n\nIf the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the job you’re launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.\n\nsecrets -> (list)\n\nThe secrets for the container. For more information, see Specifying sensitive data in the Batch User Guide .\n\n(structure)\n\nAn object representing the secret to expose to your container. Secrets can be exposed to a container in the following ways:\n\nTo inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables, use the secrets container definition parameter.\n\nTo reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container, use the secretOptions container definition parameter.\n\nFor more information, see Specifying sensitive data in the Batch User Guide .\n\nname -> (string)\n\nThe name of the secret.\n\nvalueFrom -> (string)\n\nThe secret to expose to the container.

If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.\n\nnetworkConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe network configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.\n\nassignPublicIp -> (string)\n\nIndicates whether the job should have a public IP address. For a job that is running on Fargate resources in a private subnet to send outbound traffic to the internet (for example, to pull container images), the private subnet requires a NAT gateway be attached to route requests to the internet. For more information, see Amazon ECS task networking . The default value is “DISABLED”.\n\nfargatePlatformConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe platform configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.\n\nplatformVersion -> (string)\n\nThe Fargate platform version where the jobs are running.

If the host parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon assigns a host path for your data volume. However, the data isn’t guaranteed to persist after the containers associated with it stop running.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nsourcePath -> (string)\n\nThe path on the host container instance that’s presented to the container. If this parameter is empty, then the Docker daemon has assigned a host path for you. If this parameter contains a file location, then the data volume persists at the specified location on the host container instance until you delete it manually. If the source path location doesn’t exist on the host container instance, the Docker daemon creates it. If the location does exist, the contents of the source path folder are exported.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that run on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nname -> (string)\n\nThe name of the volume.

This parameter is supported for jobs that are running on EC2 resources. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified, the container is terminated. This parameter maps to Memory in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory option to docker run . You must specify at least 4 MiB of memory for a job. This is required but can be specified in several places for multi-node parallel (MNP) jobs. It must be specified for each node at least once. This parameter maps to Memory in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory option to docker run .\n\nNote\n\nIf you’re trying to maximize your resource utilization by providing your jobs as much memory as possible for a particular instance type, see Memory Management in the Batch User Guide .\n\nFor jobs that are running on Fargate resources, then value is the hard limit (in MiB), and must match one of the supported values and the VCPU values must be one of the values supported for that memory value.\n\nvalue = 512\n\nVCPU = 0.25\n\nvalue = 1024\n\nVCPU = 0.25 or 0.5\n\nvalue = 2048\n\nVCPU = 0.25, 0.5, or 1\n\nvalue = 3072\n\nVCPU = 0.5, or 1\n\nvalue = 4096\n\nVCPU = 0.5, 1, or 2\n\nvalue = 5120, 6144, or 7168\n\nVCPU = 1 or 2\n\nvalue = 8192\n\nVCPU = 1, 2, or 4\n\nvalue = 9216, 10240, 11264, 12288, 13312, 14336, 15360, or 16384\n\nVCPU = 2 or 4\n\nvalue = 17408, 18432, 19456, 20480, 21504, 22528, 23552, 24576, 25600, 26624, 27648, 28672, 29696, or 30720\n\nVCPU = 4\n\ntype=”VCPU”\n\nThe number of vCPUs reserved for the container. This parameter maps to CpuShares in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option to docker run . Each vCPU is equivalent to 1,024 CPU shares. For EC2 resources, you must specify at least one vCPU. This is required but can be specified in several places; it must be specified for each node at least once.\n\nFor jobs that are running on Fargate resources, then value must match one of the supported values and the MEMORY values must be one of the values supported for that VCPU value. The supported values are 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4\n\nvalue = 0.25\n\nMEMORY = 512, 1024, or 2048\n\nvalue = 0.5\n\nMEMORY = 1024, 2048, 3072, or 4096\n\nvalue = 1\n\nMEMORY = 2048, 3072, 4096, 5120, 6144, 7168, or 8192\n\nvalue = 2\n\nMEMORY = 4096, 5120, 6144, 7168, 8192, 9216, 10240, 11264, 12288, 13312, 14336, 15360, or 16384\n\nvalue = 4\n\nMEMORY = 8192, 9216, 10240, 11264, 12288, 13312, 14336, 15360, 16384, 17408, 18432, 19456, 20480, 21504, 22528, 23552, 24576, 25600, 26624, 27648, 28672, 29696, or 30720\n\ntype -> (string)\n\nThe type of resource to assign to a container. The supported resources include GPU , MEMORY , and VCPU .\n\nlinuxParameters -> (structure)\n\nLinux-specific modifications that are applied to the container, such as details for device mappings.\n\ndevices -> (list)\n\nAny host devices to expose to the container. This parameter maps to Devices in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --device option to docker run .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\n(structure)\n\nAn object representing a container instance host device.\n\nNote\n\nThis object isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nhostPath -> (string)\n\nThe path for the device on the host container instance.\n\ncontainerPath -> (string)\n\nThe path inside the container that’s used to expose the host device. By default, the hostPath value is used.\n\npermissions -> (list)\n\nThe explicit permissions to provide to the container for the device. By default, the container has permissions for read , write , and mknod for the device.\n\n(string)\n\ninitProcessEnabled -> (boolean)\n\nIf true, run an init process inside the container that forwards signals and reaps processes. This parameter maps to the --init option to docker run . This parameter requires version 1.25 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep \"Server API version\"\n\nsharedMemorySize -> (integer)\n\nThe value for the size (in MiB) of the /dev/shm volume. This parameter maps to the --shm-size option to docker run .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\ntmpfs -> (list)\n\nThe container path, mount options, and size (in MiB) of the tmpfs mount. This parameter maps to the --tmpfs option to docker run .\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe container path, mount options, and size of the tmpfs mount.\n\nNote\n\nThis object isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources.\n\ncontainerPath -> (string)\n\nThe absolute file path in the container where the tmpfs volume is mounted.\n\nsize -> (integer)\n\nThe size (in MiB) of the tmpfs volume.\n\nmountOptions -> (list)\n\nThe list of tmpfs volume mount options.\n\nValid values: “defaults ” | “ro ” | “rw ” | “suid ” | “nosuid ” | “dev ” | “nodev ” | “exec ” | “noexec ” | “sync ” | “async ” | “dirsync ” | “remount ” | “mand ” | “nomand ” | “atime ” | “noatime ” | “diratime ” | “nodiratime ” | “bind ” | “rbind\" | \"unbindable\" | \"runbindable\" | \"private\" | \"rprivate\" | \"shared\" | \"rshared\" | \"slave\" | \"rslave\" | \"relatime ” | “norelatime ” | “strictatime ” | “nostrictatime ” | “mode ” | “uid ” | “gid ” | “nr_inodes ” | “nr_blocks ” | “mpol “\n\n(string)\n\nmaxSwap -> (integer)\n\nThe total amount of swap memory (in MiB) a container can use. This parameter is translated to the --memory-swap option to docker run where the value is the sum of the container memory plus the maxSwap value. For more information, see ` --memory-swap details <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/#–memory-swap-details>`__ in the Docker documentation.\n\nIf a maxSwap value of 0 is specified, the container doesn’t use swap. Accepted values are 0 or any positive integer. If the maxSwap parameter is omitted, the container doesn’t use the swap configuration for the container instance it is running on. A maxSwap value must be set for the swappiness parameter to be used.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nswappiness -> (integer)\n\nThis allows you to tune a container’s memory swappiness behavior. A swappiness value of 0 causes swapping not to happen unless absolutely necessary. A swappiness value of 100 causes pages to be swapped very aggressively. Accepted values are whole numbers between 0 and 100 . If the swappiness parameter isn’t specified, a default value of 60 is used. If a value isn’t specified for maxSwap , then this parameter is ignored. If maxSwap is set to 0, the container doesn’t use swap. This parameter maps to the --memory-swappiness option to docker run .\n\nConsider the following when you use a per-container swap configuration.\n\nSwap space must be enabled and allocated on the container instance for the containers to use.\n\nNote\n\nThe Amazon ECS optimized AMIs don’t have swap enabled by default. You must enable swap on the instance to use this feature. For more information, see Instance Store Swap Volumes in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances or How do I allocate memory to work as swap space in an Amazon EC2 instance by using a swap file?\n\nThe swap space parameters are only supported for job definitions using EC2 resources.\n\nIf the maxSwap and swappiness parameters are omitted from a job definition, each container will have a default swappiness value of 60, and the total swap usage will be limited to two times the memory reservation of the container.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter isn’t applicable to jobs that are running on Fargate resources and shouldn’t be provided.\n\nlogConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe log configuration specification for the container.\n\nThis parameter maps to LogConfig in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --log-driver option to docker run . By default, containers use the same logging driver that the Docker daemon uses. However the container might use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.\n\nNote\n\nBatch currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the LogConfiguration data type).\n\nThis parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep \"Server API version\"\n\nNote\n\nThe Amazon ECS container agent running on a container instance must register the logging drivers available on that instance with the ECS_AVAILABLE_LOGGING_DRIVERS environment variable before containers placed on that instance can use these log configuration options. For more information, see Amazon ECS Container Agent Configuration in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .\n\nlogDriver -> (string)\n\nThe log driver to use for the container. The valid values listed for this parameter are log drivers that the Amazon ECS container agent can communicate with by default.\n\nThe supported log drivers are awslogs , fluentd , gelf , json-file , journald , logentries , syslog , and splunk .\n\nNote\n\nJobs that are running on Fargate resources are restricted to the awslogs and splunk log drivers.\n\nawslogs\n\nSpecifies the Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver. For more information, see Using the awslogs Log Driver in the Batch User Guide and Amazon CloudWatch Logs logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\nfluentd\n\nSpecifies the Fluentd logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Fluentd logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\ngelf\n\nSpecifies the Graylog Extended Format (GELF) logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Graylog Extended Format logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\njournald\n\nSpecifies the journald logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Journald logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\njson-file\n\nSpecifies the JSON file logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see JSON File logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\nsplunk\n\nSpecifies the Splunk logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Splunk logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\nsyslog\n\nSpecifies the syslog logging driver. For more information, including usage and options, see Syslog logging driver in the Docker documentation.\n\nNote\n\nIf you have a custom driver that’s not listed earlier that you want to work with the Amazon ECS container agent, you can fork the Amazon ECS container agent project that’s available on GitHub and customize it to work with that driver. We encourage you to submit pull requests for changes that you want to have included. However, Amazon Web Services doesn’t currently support running modified copies of this software.\n\nThis parameter requires version 1.18 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep \"Server API version\"\n\noptions -> (map)\n\nThe configuration options to send to the log driver. This parameter requires version 1.19 of the Docker Remote API or greater on your container instance. To check the Docker Remote API version on your container instance, log into your container instance and run the following command: sudo docker version | grep \"Server API version\"\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nsecretOptions -> (list)\n\nThe secrets to pass to the log configuration. For more information, see Specifying Sensitive Data in the Batch User Guide .\n\n(structure)\n\nAn object representing the secret to expose to your container. Secrets can be exposed to a container in the following ways:\n\nTo inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables, use the secrets container definition parameter.\n\nTo reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container, use the secretOptions container definition parameter.\n\nFor more information, see Specifying sensitive data in the Batch User Guide .\n\nname -> (string)\n\nThe name of the secret.\n\nvalueFrom -> (string)\n\nThe secret to expose to the container. The supported values are either the full ARN of the Secrets Manager secret or the full ARN of the parameter in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store.\n\nNote\n\nIf the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the job you’re launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.\n\nsecrets -> (list)\n\nThe secrets for the container. For more information, see Specifying sensitive data in the Batch User Guide .\n\n(structure)\n\nAn object representing the secret to expose to your container. Secrets can be exposed to a container in the following ways:\n\nTo inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables, use the secrets container definition parameter.\n\nTo reference sensitive information in the log configuration of a container, use the secretOptions container definition parameter.\n\nFor more information, see Specifying sensitive data in the Batch User Guide .\n\nname -> (string)\n\nThe name of the secret.\n\nvalueFrom -> (string)\n\nThe secret to expose to the container. The supported values are either the full ARN of the Secrets Manager secret or the full ARN of the parameter in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store.\n\nNote\n\nIf the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter exists in the same Region as the job you’re launching, then you can use either the full ARN or name of the parameter. If the parameter exists in a different Region, then the full ARN must be specified.\n\nnetworkConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe network configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.\n\nassignPublicIp -> (string)\n\nIndicates whether the job should have a public IP address. For a job that is running on Fargate resources in a private subnet to send outbound traffic to the internet (for example, to pull container images), the private subnet requires a NAT gateway be attached to route requests to the internet. For more information, see Amazon ECS task networking . The default value is “DISABLED”.\n\nfargatePlatformConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe platform configuration for jobs that are running on Fargate resources. Jobs that are running on EC2 resources must not specify this parameter.\n\nplatformVersion -> (string)\n\nThe Fargate platform version where the jobs are running. A platform version is specified only for jobs that are running on Fargate resources. If one isn’t specified, the LATEST platform version is used by default. This uses a recent, approved version of the Fargate platform for compute resources. For more information, see Fargate platform versions in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide .\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"numNodes\": integer,\n  \"mainNode\": integer,\n  \"nodeRangeProperties\": [\n    {\n      \"targetNodes\": \"string\",\n      \"container\": {\n        \"image\": \"string\",\n        \"vcpus\": integer,\n        \"memory\": integer,\n        \"command\": [\"string\", ...],\n        \"jobRoleArn\": \"string\",\n        \"executionRoleArn\": \"string\",\n        \"volumes\": [\n          {\n            \"host\": {\n              \"sourcePath\": \"string\"\n            },\n            \"name\": \"string\",\n            \"efsVolumeConfiguration\": {\n              \"fileSystemId\": \"string\",\n              \"rootDirectory\": \"string\",\n              \"transitEncryption\": \"ENABLED\"|\"DISABLED\",\n              \"transitEncryptionPort\": integer,\n              \"authorizationConfig\": {\n                \"accessPointId\": \"string\",\n                \"iam\": \"ENABLED\"|\"DISABLED\"\n              }\n            }\n          }\n          ...\n        ],\n        \"environment\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"string\",\n            \"value\": \"string\"\n          }\n          ...\n        ],\n        \"mountPoints\": [\n          {\n            \"containerPath\": \"string\",\n            \"readOnly\": true|false,\n            \"sourceVolume\": \"string\"\n          }\n          ...\n        ],\n        \"readonlyRootFilesystem\": true|false,\n        \"privileged\": true|false,\n        \"ulimits\": [\n          {\n            \"hardLimit\": integer,\n            \"name\": \"string\",\n            \"softLimit\": integer\n          }\n          ...\n        ],\n        \"user\": \"string\",\n        \"instanceType\": \"string\",\n        \"resourceRequirements\": [\n          {\n            \"value\": \"string\",\n            \"type\": \"GPU\"|\"VCPU\"|\"MEMORY\"\n          }\n          ...\n        ],\n        \"linuxParameters\": {\n          \"devices\": [\n            {\n              \"hostPath\": \"string\",\n              \"containerPath\": \"string\",\n              \"permissions\": [\"READ\"|\"WRITE\"|\"MKNOD\", ...]\n            }\n            ...\n          ],\n          \"initProcessEnabled\": true|false,\n          \"sharedMemorySize\": integer,\n          \"tmpfs\": [\n            {\n              \"containerPath\": \"string\",\n              \"size\": integer,\n              \"mountOptions\": [\"string\", ...]\n            }\n            ...\n          ],\n          \"maxSwap\": integer,\n          \"swappiness\": integer\n        },\n        \"logConfiguration\": {\n          \"logDriver\": \"json-file\"|\"syslog\"|\"journald\"|\"gelf\"|\"fluentd\"|\"awslogs\"|\"splunk\",\n          \"options\": {\"string\": \"string\"\n            ...},\n          \"secretOptions\": [\n            {\n              \"name\": \"string\",\n              \"valueFrom\": \"string\"\n            }\n            ...\n          ]\n        },\n        \"secrets\": [\n          {\n            \"name\": \"string\",\n            \"valueFrom\": \"string\"\n          }\n          ...\n        ],\n        \"networkConfiguration\": {\n          \"assignPublicIp\": \"ENABLED\"|\"DISABLED\"\n        },\n        \"fargatePlatformConfiguration\": {\n          \"platformVersion\": \"string\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\n\n--retry-strategy (structure)\n\nThe retry strategy to use for failed jobs that are submitted with this job definition.

If no value is specified, the tags are not propagated. Tags can only be propagated to the tasks during task creation. For tags with the same name, job tags are given priority over job definitions tags. If the total number of combined tags from the job and job definition is over 50, the job is moved to the FAILED state.\n\n--timeout (structure)\n\nThe timeout configuration for jobs that are submitted with this job definition, after which Batch terminates your jobs if they have not finished. If a job is terminated due to a timeout, it isn’t retried. The minimum value for the timeout is 60 seconds.

The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml.

  "service_description": "Description\n\nUsing Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these advantages, Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively helping you to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.\n\nAs a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch automatically provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific workloads. With Batch, there’s no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus your time and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems."
