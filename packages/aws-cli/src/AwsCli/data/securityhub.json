--cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

If you are integrated with Organizations, then the administrator account is designated by the organization management account.\n\nCreateMembers is always used to add accounts that are not organization members.\n\nFor accounts that are managed using Organizations, CreateMembers is only used in the following cases:\n\nSecurity Hub is not configured to automatically add new organization accounts.\n\nThe account was disassociated or deleted in Security Hub.\n\nThis action can only be used by an account that has Security Hub enabled. To enable Security Hub, you can use the EnableSecurityHub operation.\n\nFor accounts that are not organization members, you create the account association and then send an invitation to the member account. To send the invitation, you use the InviteMembers operation. If the account owner accepts the invitation, the account becomes a member account in Security Hub.\n\nAccounts that are managed using Organizations do not receive an invitation. They automatically become a member account in Security Hub.\n\nIf the organization account does not have Security Hub enabled, then Security Hub and the default standards are automatically enabled. Note that Security Hub cannot be enabled automatically for the organization management account. The organization management account must enable Security Hub before the administrator account enables it as a member account.\n\nFor organization accounts that already have Security Hub enabled, Security Hub does not make any other changes to those accounts. It does not change their enabled standards or controls.\n\nA permissions policy is added that permits the administrator account to view the findings generated in the member account.\n\nTo remove the association between the administrator and member accounts, use the DisassociateFromMasterAccount or DisassociateMembers operation.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

Combining filters in this way always returns an error, even if the provided filter values would return valid results.\n\nYou can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.\n\nFor example, for the following filter, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .\n\nResourceType PREFIX AwsIam\n\nResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2\n\nResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy\n\nResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface\n\nResourceRegion -> (list)\n\nThe canonical Amazon Web Services external Region name where this resource is located.\n\n(structure)\n\nA string filter for querying findings.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe string filter value.

Each map filter provides the field to check, the value to look for, and the comparison operator.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nThe key of the map filter. For example, for ResourceTags , Key identifies the name of the tag. For UserDefinedFields , Key is the name of the field.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe value for the key in the map filter. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a tag called Department might be Security . If you provide security as the filter value, then there is no match.\n\nComparison -> (string)\n\nThe condition to apply to the key value when querying for findings with a map filter.\n\nTo search for values that exactly match the filter value, use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security matches findings that have the value Security for the tag Department .\n\nTo search for values other than the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS .

(string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--starting-token (string)\n\nA token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--page-size (integer)\n\nThe size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command’s output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--max-items (integer)\n\nThe total number of items to return in the command’s output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command’s output. To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--starting-token (string)\n\nA token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--page-size (integer)\n\nThe size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command’s output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--max-items (integer)\n\nThe total number of items to return in the command’s output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command’s output. To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

For example, the filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings that have a resource type that does not start with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from the results.\n\nNOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters.\n\nFor filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters in this way always returns an error, even if the provided filter values would return valid results.\n\nYou can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.\n\nFor example, for the following filter, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .\n\nResourceType PREFIX AwsIam\n\nResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2\n\nResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy\n\nResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface\n\nGroupByAttribute -> (string)\n\nThe grouping attribute for the insight’s findings. Indicates how to group the matching findings, and identifies the type of item that the insight applies to. For example, if an insight is grouped by resource identifier, then the insight produces a list of resource identifiers.\n\nNextToken -> (string)\n\nThe pagination token to use to request the next page of results.",

Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as the filter text, then there is no match.\n\nComparison -> (string)\n\nThe condition to apply to a string value when querying for findings. To search for values that contain the filter criteria value, use one of the following comparison operators:\n\nTo search for values that exactly match the filter value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter ResourceType EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .\n\nTo search for values that start with the filter value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that have a resource type that starts with AwsIam .

Filter values are case sensitive. For example, the product name for control-based findings is Security Hub . If you provide security hub as the filter text, then there is no match.\n\nComparison -> (string)\n\nThe condition to apply to a string value when querying for findings. To search for values that contain the filter criteria value, use one of the following comparison operators:\n\nTo search for values that exactly match the filter value, use EQUALS . For example, the filter ResourceType EQUALS AwsEc2SecurityGroup only matches findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2SecurityGroup .\n\nTo search for values that start with the filter value, use PREFIX . For example, the filter ResourceType PREFIX AwsIam matches findings that have a resource type that starts with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all match.\n\nEQUALS and PREFIX filters on the same field are joined by OR . A finding matches if it matches any one of those filters.\n\nTo search for values that do not contain the filter criteria value, use one of the following comparison operators:\n\nTo search for values that do not exactly match the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter ResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy matches findings that have a resource type other than AwsIamPolicy .\n\nTo search for values that do not start with the filter value, use PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS . For example, the filter ResourceType PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS AwsIam matches findings that have a resource type that does not start with AwsIam . Findings with a resource type of AwsIamPolicy , AwsIamRole , or AwsIamUser would all be excluded from the results.\n\nNOT_EQUALS and PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters on the same field are joined by AND . A finding matches only if it matches all of those filters.\n\nFor filters on the same field, you cannot provide both an EQUALS filter and a NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filter. Combining filters in this way always returns an error, even if the provided filter values would return valid results.\n\nYou can combine PREFIX filters with NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters for the same field. Security Hub first processes the PREFIX filters, then the NOT_EQUALS or PREFIX_NOT_EQUALS filters.\n\nFor example, for the following filter, Security Hub first identifies findings that have resource types that start with either AwsIAM or AwsEc2 . It then excludes findings that have a resource type of AwsIamPolicy and findings that have a resource type of AwsEc2NetworkInterface .\n\nResourceType PREFIX AwsIam\n\nResourceType PREFIX AwsEc2\n\nResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsIamPolicy\n\nResourceType NOT_EQUALS AwsEc2NetworkInterface\n\nAwsAccountId -> (list)\n\nThe Amazon Web Services account ID that a finding is generated in.\n\n(structure)\n\nA string filter for querying findings.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe string filter value.

For example, for ResourceTags , Key identifies the name of the tag. For UserDefinedFields , Key is the name of the field.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe value for the key in the map filter. Filter values are case sensitive. For example, one of the values for a tag called Department might be Security . If you provide security as the filter value, then there is no match.\n\nComparison -> (string)\n\nThe condition to apply to the key value when querying for findings with a map filter.\n\nTo search for values that exactly match the filter value, use EQUALS . For example, for the ResourceTags field, the filter Department EQUALS Security matches findings that have the value Security for the tag Department .\n\nTo search for values other than the filter value, use NOT_EQUALS .

This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

  "service_description": "Description\n\nSecurity Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of the security state of your Amazon Web Services environment and resources. It also provides you with the readiness status of your environment based on controls from supported security standards. Security Hub collects security data from Amazon Web Services accounts, services, and integrated third-party products and helps you analyze security trends in your environment to identify the highest priority security issues. For more information about Security Hub, see the *Security Hub`User Guide <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html>`__ * .\n\nWhen you use operations in the Security Hub API, the requests are executed only in the Amazon Web Services Region that is currently active or in the specific Amazon Web Services Region that you specify in your request. Any configuration or settings change that results from the operation is applied only to that Region. To make the same change in other Regions, execute the same command for each Region to apply the change to.\n\nFor example, if your Region is set to us-west-2 , when you use CreateMembers to add a member account to Security Hub, the association of the member account with the administrator account is created only in the us-west-2 Region. Security Hub must be enabled for the member account in the same Region that the invitation was sent from.\n\nThe following throttling limits apply to using Security Hub API operations.\n\nBatchEnableStandards - RateLimit of 1 request per second, BurstLimit of 1 request per second.\n\nGetFindings - RateLimit of 3 requests per second. BurstLimit of 6 requests per second.\n\nUpdateFindings - RateLimit of 1 request per second. BurstLimit of 5 requests per second.\n\nUpdateStandardsControl - RateLimit of 1 request per second, BurstLimit of 5 requests per second.\n\nAll other operations - RateLimit of 10 requests per second. BurstLimit of 30 requests per second."
