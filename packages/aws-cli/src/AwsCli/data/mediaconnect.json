This parameter is required for SPEKE encryption and is not valid for static key encryption.\n\nDescription -> (string)\n\nA description for the source. This value is not used or seen outside of the current AWS Elemental MediaConnect account.\n\nEntitlementArn -> (string)\n\nThe ARN of the entitlement that allows you to subscribe to content that comes from another AWS account. The entitlement is set by the content originator and the ARN is generated as part of the originator’s flow.\n\nIngestIp -> (string)\n\nThe IP address that the flow will be listening on for incoming content.\n\nIngestPort -> (integer)\n\nThe port that the flow will be listening on for incoming content.\n\nMediaStreamSourceConfigurations -> (list)\n\nThe media streams that are associated with the source, and the parameters for those associations.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe media stream that is associated with the source, and the parameters for that association.\n\nEncodingName -> (string)\n\nThe format that was used to encode the data. For ancillary data streams, set the encoding name to smpte291. For audio streams, set the encoding name to pcm. For video, 2110 streams, set the encoding name to raw. For video, JPEG XS streams, set the encoding name to jxsv.\n\nInputConfigurations -> (list)\n\nThe transport parameters that are associated with an incoming media stream.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe transport parameters that are associated with an incoming media stream.\n\nInputIp -> (string)\n\nThe IP address that the flow listens on for incoming content for a media stream.\n\nInputPort -> (integer)\n\nThe port that the flow listens on for an incoming media stream.\n\nInterface -> (structure)\n\nThe VPC interface where the media stream comes in from.\n\nName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the VPC interface.\n\nMediaStreamName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the media stream.\n\nName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the source.\n\nSourceArn -> (string)\n\nThe ARN of the source.\n\nTransport -> (structure)\n\nAttributes related to the transport stream that are used in the source.\n\nCidrAllowList -> (list)\n\nThe range of IP addresses that should be allowed to initiate output requests to this flow. These IP addresses should be in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16.\n\n(string)\n\nMaxBitrate -> (integer)\n\nThe smoothing max bitrate for RIST, RTP, and RTP-FEC streams.\n\nMaxLatency -> (integer)\n\nThe maximum latency in milliseconds. This parameter applies only to RIST-based and Zixi-based streams.\n\nMaxSyncBuffer -> (integer)\n\nThe size of the buffer (in milliseconds) to use to sync incoming source data.\n\nMinLatency -> (integer)\n\nThe minimum latency in milliseconds for SRT-based streams. In streams that use the SRT protocol, this value that you set on your MediaConnect source or output represents the minimal potential latency of that connection. The latency of the stream is set to the highest number between the sender’s minimum latency and the receiver’s minimum latency.\n\nProtocol -> (string)\n\nThe protocol that is used by the source or output.\n\nRemoteId -> (string)\n\nThe remote ID for the Zixi-pull stream.\n\nSmoothingLatency -> (integer)\n\nThe smoothing latency in milliseconds for RIST, RTP, and RTP-FEC streams.\n\nStreamId -> (string)\n\nThe stream ID that you want to use for this transport. This parameter applies only to Zixi-based streams.\n\nVpcInterfaceName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the VPC interface that is used for this source.\n\nWhitelistCidr -> (string)\n\nThe range of IP addresses that should be allowed to contribute content to your source. These IP addresses should be in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block; for example, 10.0.0.0/16.",
