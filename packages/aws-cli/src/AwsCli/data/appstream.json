Users are notified before they are disconnected due to inactivity. If they try to reconnect to the streaming session before the time interval specified in DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are connected to their previous session. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads and downloads, audio in, audio out, and pixels changing do not qualify as user activity. If users continue to be idle after the time interval in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.\n\nTo prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and 3600. The default value is 0.\n\nNote\n\nIf you enable this feature, we recommend that you specify a value that corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don’t do this, the value is rounded to the nearest minute. For example, if you specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after 1 minute of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between two different minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you specify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes of inactivity.\n\n--iam-role-arn (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role to apply to the fleet. To assume a role, a fleet instance calls the AWS Security Token Service (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of the role to use. The operation creates a new session with temporary credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and creates the appstream_machine_role credential profile on the instance.\n\nFor more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0 Streaming Instances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .\n\n--stream-view (string)\n\nThe AppStream 2.0 view that is displayed to your users when they stream from the fleet. When APP is specified, only the windows of applications opened by users display. When DESKTOP is specified, the standard desktop that is provided by the operating system displays.\n\nThe default value is APP .\n\nPossible values:\n\nAPP\n\nDESKTOP\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.

Users are notified before they are disconnected due to inactivity. If users try to reconnect to the streaming session before the time interval specified in DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are connected to their previous session. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads and downloads, audio in, audio out, and pixels changing do not qualify as user activity. If users continue to be idle after the time interval in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.\n\nTo prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and 3600. The default value is 0.\n\nNote\n\nIf you enable this feature, we recommend that you specify a value that corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don’t do this, the value is rounded to the nearest minute. For example, if you specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after 1 minute of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between two different minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you specify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes of inactivity.\n\nIamRoleArn -> (string)\n\nThe ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the fleet. To assume a role, the fleet instance calls the AWS Security Token Service (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of the role to use. The operation creates a new session with temporary credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and creates the appstream_machine_role credential profile on the instance.\n\nFor more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0 Streaming Instances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .\n\nStreamView -> (string)\n\nThe AppStream 2.0 view that is displayed to your users when they stream from the fleet. When APP is specified, only the windows of applications opened by users display. When DESKTOP is specified, the standard desktop that is provided by the operating system displays.\n\nThe default value is APP ."

If they try to reconnect to the streaming session after a disconnection or network interruption within this time interval, they are connected to their previous session. Otherwise, they are connected to a new session with a new streaming instance.\n\nSpecify a value between 60 and 360000.\n\nState -> (string)\n\nThe current state for the fleet.\n\nVpcConfig -> (structure)\n\nThe VPC configuration for the fleet.\n\nSubnetIds -> (list)\n\nThe identifiers of the subnets to which a network interface is attached from the fleet instance or image builder instance. Fleet instances use one or more subnets. Image builder instances use one subnet.\n\n(string)\n\nSecurityGroupIds -> (list)\n\nThe identifiers of the security groups for the fleet or image builder.\n\n(string)\n\nCreatedTime -> (timestamp)\n\nThe time the fleet was created.\n\nFleetErrors -> (list)\n\nThe fleet errors.\n\n(structure)\n\nDescribes a fleet error.\n\nErrorCode -> (string)\n\nThe error code.\n\nErrorMessage -> (string)\n\nThe error message.\n\nEnableDefaultInternetAccess -> (boolean)\n\nIndicates whether default internet access is enabled for the fleet.\n\nDomainJoinInfo -> (structure)\n\nThe name of the directory and organizational unit (OU) to use to join the fleet to a Microsoft Active Directory domain.\n\nDirectoryName -> (string)\n\nThe fully qualified name of the directory (for example, corp.example.com).\n\nOrganizationalUnitDistinguishedName -> (string)\n\nThe distinguished name of the organizational unit for computer accounts.\n\nIdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds -> (integer)\n\nThe amount of time that users can be idle (inactive) before they are disconnected from their streaming session and the DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds time interval begins. Users are notified before they are disconnected due to inactivity. If users try to reconnect to the streaming session before the time interval specified in DisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are connected to their previous session. Users are considered idle when they stop providing keyboard or mouse input during their streaming session. File uploads and downloads, audio in, audio out, and pixels changing do not qualify as user activity. If users continue to be idle after the time interval in IdleDisconnectTimeoutInSeconds elapses, they are disconnected.\n\nTo prevent users from being disconnected due to inactivity, specify a value of 0. Otherwise, specify a value between 60 and 3600. The default value is 0.\n\nNote\n\nIf you enable this feature, we recommend that you specify a value that corresponds exactly to a whole number of minutes (for example, 60, 120, and 180). If you don’t do this, the value is rounded to the nearest minute. For example, if you specify a value of 70, users are disconnected after 1 minute of inactivity. If you specify a value that is at the midpoint between two different minutes, the value is rounded up. For example, if you specify a value of 90, users are disconnected after 2 minutes of inactivity.\n\nIamRoleArn -> (string)\n\nThe ARN of the IAM role that is applied to the fleet. To assume a role, the fleet instance calls the AWS Security Token Service (STS) AssumeRole API operation and passes the ARN of the role to use. The operation creates a new session with temporary credentials. AppStream 2.0 retrieves the temporary credentials and creates the appstream_machine_role credential profile on the instance.\n\nFor more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications and Scripts Running on AppStream 2.0 Streaming Instances in the Amazon AppStream 2.0 Administration Guide .\n\nStreamView -> (string)\n\nThe AppStream 2.0 view that is displayed to your users when they stream from the fleet. When APP is specified, only the windows of applications opened by users display. When DESKTOP is specified, the standard desktop that is provided by the operating system displays.\n\nThe default value is APP .\n\nNextToken -> (string)\n\nThe pagination token to use to retrieve the next page of results for this operation. If there are no more pages, this value is null."
