Each endpoint group can include one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.\n\nEndpointId -> (string)\n\nAn ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID.\n\nAn Application Load Balancer can be either internal or internet-facing.\n\nWeight -> (integer)\n\nThe weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint. For more information, see Endpoint Weights in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .\n\nHealthState -> (string)\n\nThe health status of the endpoint.\n\nHealthReason -> (string)\n\nReturns a null result.\n\nClientIPPreservationEnabled -> (boolean)\n\nIndicates whether client IP address preservation is enabled for an Application Load Balancer endpoint. The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators.\n\nIf the value is set to true, the client’s IP address is preserved in the X-Forwarded-For request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.\n\nFor more information, see Viewing Client IP Addresses in AWS Global Accelerator in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .\n\nTrafficDialPercentage -> (float)\n\nThe percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Region. Additional traffic is distributed to other endpoint groups for this listener.\n\nUse this action to increase (dial up) or decrease (dial down) traffic to a specific Region. The percentage is applied to the traffic that would otherwise have been routed to the Region based on optimal routing.\n\nThe default value is 100.\n\nHealthCheckPort -> (integer)\n\nThe port that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group.\n\nThe default port is the port for the listener that this endpoint group is associated with. If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified port in the list of ports.\n\nHealthCheckProtocol -> (string)\n\nThe protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.\n\nHealthCheckPath -> (string)\n\nIf the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path that Global Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).\n\nHealthCheckIntervalSeconds -> (integer)\n\nThe time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between health checks for each endpoint. The default value is 30.\n\nThresholdCount -> (integer)\n\nThe number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.\n\nPortOverrides -> (list)\n\nAllows you to override the destination ports used to route traffic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you to map a list of external destination ports (that your users send traffic to) to a list of internal destination ports that you want an application endpoint to receive traffic on.\n\n(structure)\n\nOverride specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of an endpoint group. For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.\n\nFor more information, see Port overrides in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .\n\nListenerPort -> (integer)\n\nThe listener port that you want to map to a specific endpoint port. This is the port that user traffic arrives to the Global Accelerator on.\n\nEndpointPort -> (integer)\n\nThe endpoint port that you want a listener port to be mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as the Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.",

If client affinity is NONE , Global Accelerator uses the “five-tuple” (5-tuple) properties—source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and protocol—to select the hash value, and then chooses the best endpoint. However, with this setting, if someone uses different ports to connect to Global Accelerator, their connections might not be always routed to the same endpoint because the hash value changes.\n\nIf you want a given client to always be routed to the same endpoint, set client affinity to SOURCE_IP instead.

Each endpoint group can include one or more endpoints, such as load balancers.\n\nEndpointId -> (string)\n\nAn ID for the endpoint. If the endpoint is a Network Load Balancer or Application Load Balancer, this is the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource. If the endpoint is an Elastic IP address, this is the Elastic IP address allocation ID. For Amazon EC2 instances, this is the EC2 instance ID.\n\nAn Application Load Balancer can be either internal or internet-facing.\n\nWeight -> (integer)\n\nThe weight associated with the endpoint. When you add weights to endpoints, you configure AWS Global Accelerator to route traffic based on proportions that you specify. For example, you might specify endpoint weights of 4, 5, 5, and 6 (sum=20). The result is that 4/20 of your traffic, on average, is routed to the first endpoint, 5/20 is routed both to the second and third endpoints, and 6/20 is routed to the last endpoint.

The value is true or false. The default value is true for new accelerators.\n\nIf the value is set to true, the client’s IP address is preserved in the X-Forwarded-For request header as traffic travels to applications on the Application Load Balancer endpoint fronted by the accelerator.\n\nFor more information, see Viewing Client IP Addresses in AWS Global Accelerator in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .\n\nTrafficDialPercentage -> (float)\n\nThe percentage of traffic to send to an AWS Region.

If the listener port is a list, Global Accelerator uses the first specified port in the list of ports.\n\nHealthCheckProtocol -> (string)\n\nThe protocol that Global Accelerator uses to perform health checks on endpoints that are part of this endpoint group. The default value is TCP.\n\nHealthCheckPath -> (string)\n\nIf the protocol is HTTP/S, then this value provides the ping path that Global Accelerator uses for the destination on the endpoints for health checks. The default is slash (/).\n\nHealthCheckIntervalSeconds -> (integer)\n\nThe time—10 seconds or 30 seconds—between health checks for each endpoint. The default value is 30.\n\nThresholdCount -> (integer)\n\nThe number of consecutive health checks required to set the state of a healthy endpoint to unhealthy, or to set an unhealthy endpoint to healthy. The default value is 3.\n\nPortOverrides -> (list)\n\nAllows you to override the destination ports used to route traffic to an endpoint. Using a port override lets you to map a list of external destination ports (that your users send traffic to) to a list of internal destination ports that you want an application endpoint to receive traffic on.\n\n(structure)\n\nOverride specific listener ports used to route traffic to endpoints that are part of an endpoint group. For example, you can create a port override in which the listener receives user traffic on ports 80 and 443, but your accelerator routes that traffic to ports 1080 and 1443, respectively, on the endpoints.\n\nFor more information, see Port overrides in the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .\n\nListenerPort -> (integer)\n\nThe listener port that you want to map to a specific endpoint port. This is the port that user traffic arrives to the Global Accelerator on.\n\nEndpointPort -> (integer)\n\nThe endpoint port that you want a listener port to be mapped to. This is the port on the endpoint, such as the Application Load Balancer or Amazon EC2 instance.\n\nNextToken -> (string)\n\nThe token for the next set of results.

  "service_description": "Description\n\nThis is the AWS Global Accelerator API Reference . This guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide .\n\nAWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve the performance of your applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits.\n\nBy using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network.\n\nFor other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints.\n\nWarning\n\nGlobal Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple AWS Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create or update accelerators.\n\nBy default, Global Accelerator provides you with two static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. With a standard accelerator, instead of using the IP addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge network. For a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple AWS Regions, which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one AWS Region or multiple Regions. For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets.\n\nWarning\n\nThe static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see Tag-based policies .\n\nFor standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always directed to healthy endpoints.\n\nFor a list of the AWS Regions where Global Accelerator and other services are currently supported, see the AWS Region Table .\n\nAWS Global Accelerator includes the following components:\n\nStatic IP addresses\n\nGlobal Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses that are anycast from the AWS edge network. If you bring your own IP address range to AWS (BYOIP) to use with a standard accelerator, you can instead assign IP addresses from your own pool to use with your accelerator. For more information, see Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in AWS Global Accelerator .\n\nThe IP addresses serve as single fixed entry points for your clients. If you already have Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP address resources set up for your applications, you can easily add those to a standard accelerator in Global Accelerator. This allows Global Accelerator to use static IP addresses to access the resources.\n\nThe static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to delete an accelerator. For more information, see Tag-based policies .\n\nAccelerator\n\nAn accelerator directs traffic to endpoints over the AWS global network to improve the performance of your internet applications. Each accelerator includes one or more listeners.\n\nThere are two types of accelerators:\n\nA standard accelerator directs traffic to the optimal AWS endpoint based on several factors, including the user’s location, the health of the endpoint, and the endpoint weights that you configure. This improves the availability and performance of your applications. Endpoints can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses.\n\nA custom routing accelerator directs traffic to one of possibly thousands of Amazon EC2 instances running in a single or multiple virtual private clouds (VPCs). With custom routing, listener ports are mapped to statically associate port ranges with VPC subnets, which allows Global Accelerator to determine an EC2 instance IP address at the time of connection. By default, all port mapping destinations in a VPC subnet can’t receive traffic. You can choose to configure all destinations in the subnet to receive traffic, or to specify individual port mappings that can receive traffic.\n\nFor more information, see Types of accelerators .\n\nDNS name\n\nGlobal Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System (DNS) name, similar to a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com , that points to the static IP addresses that Global Accelerator assigns to you or that you choose from your own IP address range. Depending on the use case, you can use your accelerator’s static IP addresses or DNS name to route traffic to your accelerator, or set up DNS records to route traffic using your own custom domain name.\n\nNetwork zone\n\nA network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network zone.\n\nListener\n\nA listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the port (or port range) and protocol (or protocols) that you configure. A listener can be configured for TCP, UDP, or both TCP and UDP protocols. Each listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to distribute traffic to. With a standard accelerator, traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with a listener.\n\nEndpoint group\n\nEach endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups include one or more endpoints in the Region. With a standard accelerator, you can increase or reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by adjusting a setting called a traffic dial . The traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing, for example, for new releases across different AWS Regions.\n\nEndpoint\n\nAn endpoint is a resource that Global Accelerator directs traffic to.\n\nEndpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses. An Application Load Balancer endpoint can be internet-facing or internal. Traffic for standard accelerators is routed to endpoints based on the health of the endpoint along with configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for example, to do performance testing within a Region.\n\nEndpoints for custom routing accelerators are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets with one or many EC2 instances."
