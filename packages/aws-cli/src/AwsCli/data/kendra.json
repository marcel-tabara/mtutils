For example, the host name of https://a.example.com/page1.html is “a.example.com” and the port is 443, the standard port for HTTPS.\n\nWeb proxy credentials are optional and you can use them to connect to a web proxy server that requires basic authentication. To store web proxy credentials, you use a secret in AWS Secrets Manager .\n\nHost -> (string)\n\nThe name of the website host you want to connect to via a web proxy server.\n\nFor example, the host name of https://a.example.com/page1.html is “a.example.com”.\n\nPort -> (integer)\n\nThe port number of the website host you want to connect to via a web proxy server.\n\nFor example, the port for https://a.example.com/page1.html is 443, the standard port for HTTPS.\n\nCredentials -> (string)\n\nYour secret ARN, which you can create in AWS Secrets Manager\n\nThe credentials are optional. You use a secret if web proxy credentials are required to connect to a website host. Amazon Kendra currently support basic authentication to connect to a web proxy server. The secret stores your credentials.\n\nAuthenticationConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nProvides configuration information required to connect to websites using authentication.\n\nYou can connect to websites using basic authentication of user name and password.\n\nYou must provide the website host name and port number. For example, the host name of https://a.example.com/page1.html is “a.example.com” and the port is 443, the standard port for HTTPS. You use a secret in AWS Secrets Manager to store your authentication credentials.\n\nBasicAuthentication -> (list)\n\nThe list of configuration information that’s required to connect to and crawl a website host using basic authentication credentials.\n\nThe list includes the name and port number of the website host.\n\n(structure)\n\nProvides the configuration information to connect to websites that require basic user authentication.\n\nHost -> (string)\n\nThe name of the website host you want to connect to using authentication credentials.\n\nFor example, the host name of https://a.example.com/page1.html is “a.example.com”.\n\nPort -> (integer)\n\nThe port number of the website host you want to connect to using authentication credentials.\n\nFor example, the port for https://a.example.com/page1.html is 443, the standard port for HTTPS.\n\nCredentials -> (string)\n\nYour secret ARN, which you can create in AWS Secrets Manager\n\nYou use a secret if basic authentication credentials are required to connect to a website. The secret stores your credentials of user name and password.\n\nWorkDocsConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nProvides the configuration information to connect to WorkDocs as your data source.\n\nOrganizationId -> (string)\n\nThe identifier of the directory corresponding to your Amazon WorkDocs site repository.\n\nYou can find the organization ID in the AWS Directory Service by going to Active Directory , then Directories . Your Amazon WorkDocs site directory has an ID, which is the organization ID. You can also set up a new Amazon WorkDocs directory in the AWS Directory Service console and enable a Amazon WorkDocs site for the directory in the Amazon WorkDocs console.\n\nCrawlComments -> (boolean)\n\nTRUE to include comments on documents in your index. Including comments in your index means each comment is a document that can be searched on.\n\nThe default is set to FALSE .\n\nUseChangeLog -> (boolean)\n\nTRUE to use the change logs to update documents in your index instead of scanning all documents.\n\nIf you are syncing your Amazon WorkDocs data source with your index for the first time, all documents are scanned. After your first sync, you can use the change logs to update your documents in your index for future syncs.\n\nThe default is set to FALSE .\n\nInclusionPatterns -> (list)\n\nA list of regular expression patterns to include certain files in your Amazon WorkDocs site repository. Files that match the patterns are included in the index. Files that don’t match the patterns are excluded from the index. If a file matches both an inclusion pattern and an exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the file isn’t included in the index.\n\n(string)\n\nExclusionPatterns -> (list)\n\nA list of regular expression patterns to exclude certain files in your Amazon WorkDocs site repository. Files that match the patterns are excluded from the index. Files that don’t match the patterns are included in the index. If a file matches both an inclusion pattern and an exclusion pattern, the exclusion pattern takes precedence and the file isn’t included in the index.\n\n(string)\n\nFieldMappings -> (list)\n\nA list of DataSourceToIndexFieldMapping objects that map Amazon WorkDocs field names to custom index field names in Amazon Kendra. You must first create the custom index fields using the UpdateIndex operation before you map to Amazon WorkDocs fields. For more information, see Mapping Data Source Fields . The Amazon WorkDocs data source field names need to exist in your Amazon WorkDocs custom metadata.\n\n(structure)\n\nMaps a column or attribute in the data source to an index field. You must first create the fields in the index using the UpdateIndex operation.\n\nDataSourceFieldName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the column or attribute in the data source.\n\nDateFieldFormat -> (string)\n\nThe type of data stored in the column or attribute.\n\nIndexFieldName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the field in the index.\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"S3Configuration\": {\n    \"BucketName\":

Only applies to DATE fields.\n\nImportance -> (integer)\n\nThe relative importance of the field in the search. Larger numbers provide more of a boost than smaller numbers.\n\nDuration -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the time period that the boost applies to. For example, to make the boost apply to documents with the field value within the last month, you would use “2628000s”. Once the field value is beyond the specified range, the effect of the boost drops off. The higher the importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you don’t specify a value, the default is 3 months. The value of the field is a numeric string followed by the character “s”, for example “86400s” for one day, or “604800s” for one week.\n\nOnly applies to DATE fields.\n\nRankOrder -> (string)\n\nDetermines how values should be interpreted.\n\nWhen the RankOrder field is ASCENDING , higher numbers are better. For example, a document with a rating score of 10 is higher ranking than a document with a rating score of 1.\n\nWhen the RankOrder field is DESCENDING , lower numbers are better.

This contains the capacity units used for the index. A 0 for the query capacity or the storage capacity indicates that the index is using the default capacity for the index.\n\nStorageCapacityUnits -> (integer)\n\nThe amount of extra storage capacity for an index. A single capacity unit provides 30 GB of storage space or 100,000 documents, whichever is reached first.\n\nQueryCapacityUnits -> (integer)\n\nThe amount of extra query capacity for an index and GetQuerySuggestions capacity.\n\nA single extra capacity unit for an index provides 0.1 queries per second or approximately 8,000 queries per day.\n\nGetQuerySuggestions capacity is five times the provisioned query capacity for an index, or the base capacity of 2.5 calls per second, whichever is higher. For example, the base capacity for an index is 0.1 queries per second, and GetQuerySuggestions capacity has a base of 2.5 calls per second. If you add another 0.1 queries per second to total 0.2 queries per second for an index, the GetQuerySuggestions capacity is 2.5 calls per second (higher than five times 0.2 queries per second).\n\nUserTokenConfigurations -> (list)\n\nThe user token configuration for the Amazon Kendra index.\n\n(structure)\n\nProvides configuration information for a token configuration.\n\nJwtTokenTypeConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nInformation about the JWT token type configuration.\n\nKeyLocation -> (string)\n\nThe location of the key.\n\nURL -> (string)\n\nThe signing key URL.\n\nSecretManagerArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (arn) of the secret.\n\nUserNameAttributeField -> (string)\n\nThe user name attribute field.\n\nGroupAttributeField -> (string)\n\nThe group attribute field.\n\nIssuer -> (string)\n\nThe issuer of the token.\n\nClaimRegex -> (string)\n\nThe regular expression that identifies the claim.\n\nJsonTokenTypeConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nInformation about the JSON token type configuration.\n\nUserNameAttributeField -> (string)\n\nThe user name attribute field.\n\nGroupAttributeField -> (string)\n\nThe group attribute field.\n\nUserContextPolicy -> (string)\n\nThe user context policy for the Amazon Kendra index.\n\nUserGroupResolutionConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nShows whether you have enabled the configuration for fetching access levels of groups and users from an AWS Single Sign-On identity source.\n\nUserGroupResolutionMode -> (string)\n\nThe identity store provider (mode) you want to use to fetch access levels of groups and users.

No other document attributes are included in the response. By default all document attributes are included in the response.\n\n(string)\n\nSyntax:\n\n\"string\" \"string\" ...\n\n\n--query-result-type-filter (string)\n\nSets the type of query. Only results for the specified query type are returned.\n\nPossible values:\n\nDOCUMENT\n\nQUESTION_ANSWER\n\nANSWER\n\n--document-relevance-override-configurations (list)\n\nOverrides relevance tuning configurations of fields or attributes set at the index level.\n\nIf you use this API to override the relevance tuning configured at the index level, but there is no relevance tuning configured at the index level, then Amazon Kendra does not apply any relevance tuning.\n\nIf there is relevance tuning configured at the index level, but you do not use this API to override any relevance tuning in the index, then Amazon Kendra uses the relevance tuning that is configured at the index level.\n\nIf there is relevance tuning configured for fields at the index level, but you use this API to override only some of these fields, then for the fields you did not override, the importance is set to 1.\n\n(structure)\n\nOverrides the document relevance properties of a custom index field.\n\nName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the tuning configuration to override document relevance at the index level.\n\nRelevance -> (structure)\n\nProvides information for manually tuning the relevance of a field in a search. When a query includes terms that match the field, the results are given a boost in the response based on these tuning parameters.\n\nFreshness -> (boolean)\n\nIndicates that this field determines how “fresh” a document is. For example, if document 1 was created on November 5, and document 2 was created on October 31, document 1 is “fresher” than document 2. You can only set the Freshness field on one DATE type field. Only applies to DATE fields.\n\nImportance -> (integer)\n\nThe relative importance of the field in the search. Larger numbers provide more of a boost than smaller numbers.\n\nDuration -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the time period that the boost applies to. For example, to make the boost apply to documents with the field value within the last month, you would use “2628000s”. Once the field value is beyond the specified range, the effect of the boost drops off. The higher the importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you don’t specify a value, the default is 3 months. The value of the field is a numeric string followed by the character “s”, for example “86400s” for one day, or “604800s” for one week.\n\nOnly applies to DATE fields.\n\nRankOrder -> (string)\n\nDetermines how values should be interpreted.\n\nWhen the RankOrder field is ASCENDING , higher numbers are better. For example, a document with a rating score of 10 is higher ranking than a document with a rating score of 1.\n\nWhen the RankOrder field is DESCENDING , lower numbers are better. For example, in a task tracking application, a priority 1 task is more important than a priority 5 task.\n\nOnly applies to LONG and DOUBLE fields.\n\nValueImportanceMap -> (map)\n\nA list of values that should be given a different boost when they appear in the result list. For example, if you are boosting a field called “department,” query terms that match the department field are boosted in the result. However, you can add entries from the department field to boost documents with those values higher.\n\nFor example, you can add entries to the map with names of departments. If you add “HR”,5 and “Legal”,3 those departments are given special attention when they appear in the metadata of a document. When those terms appear they are given the specified importance instead of the regular importance for the boost.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (integer)\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nName=string,Relevance={Freshness=boolean,Importance=integer,Duration=string,RankOrder=string,ValueImportanceMap={KeyName1=integer,KeyName2=integer}} ...\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Name\": \"string\",\n    \"Relevance\": {\n      \"Freshness\": true|false,\n      \"Importance\": integer,\n      \"Duration\": \"string\",\n      \"RankOrder\": \"ASCENDING\"|\"DESCENDING\",\n      \"ValueImportanceMap\": {\"string\": integer\n        ...}\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--page-number (integer)\n\nQuery results are returned in pages the size of the PageSize parameter. By default, Amazon Kendra returns the first page of results. Use this parameter to get result pages after the first one.\n\n--page-size (integer)\n\nSets the number of results that are returned in each page of results. The default page size is 10. The maximum number of results returned is 100. If you ask for more than 100 results, only 100 are returned.\n\n--sorting-configuration (structure)\n\nProvides information that determines how the results of the query are sorted. You can set the field that Amazon Kendra should sort the results on, and specify whether the results should be sorted in ascending or descending order. In the case of ties in sorting the results, the results are sorted by relevance.\n\nIf you don’t provide sorting configuration, the results are sorted by the relevance that Amazon Kendra determines for the result.\n\nDocumentAttributeKey -> (string)\n\nThe name of the document attribute used to sort the response. You can use any field that has the Sortable flag set to true.\n\nYou can also sort by any of the following built-in attributes:\n\n_category\n\n_created_at\n\n_last_updated_at\n\n_version\n\n_view_count\n\nSortOrder -> (string)\n\nThe order that the results should be returned in. In case of ties, the relevance assigned to the result by Amazon Kendra is used as the tie-breaker.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nDocumentAttributeKey=string,SortOrder=string\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"DocumentAttributeKey\": \"string\",\n  \"SortOrder\": \"DESC\"|\"ASC\"\n}\n\n\n--user-context (structure)\n\nThe user context token or user and group information.\n\nToken -> (string)\n\nThe user context token for filtering search results for a user.

This is for filtering search results based on the groups’ access to documents.\n\nDataSourceId -> (string)\n\nThe identifier of the data source group you want to add to your list of data source groups. This is for filtering search results based on the groups’ access to documents in that data source.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nToken=string,UserId=string,Groups=string,string,DataSourceGroups=[{GroupId=string,DataSourceId=string},{GroupId=string,DataSourceId=string}]\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"Token\": \"string\",\n  \"UserId\": \"string\",\n  \"Groups\": [\"string\", ...],\n  \"DataSourceGroups\": [\n    {\n      \"GroupId\": \"string\",\n      \"DataSourceId\": \"string\"\n    }\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n\n\n--visitor-id (string)\n\nProvides an identifier for a specific user. The VisitorId should be a unique identifier, such as a GUID. Don’t use personally identifiable information, such as the user’s email address, as the VisitorId .\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json.

For example, if document 1 was created on November 5, and document 2 was created on October 31, document 1 is “fresher” than document 2. You can only set the Freshness field on one DATE type field. Only applies to DATE fields.\n\nImportance -> (integer)\n\nThe relative importance of the field in the search. Larger numbers provide more of a boost than smaller numbers.\n\nDuration -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the time period that the boost applies to. For example, to make the boost apply to documents with the field value within the last month, you would use “2628000s”. Once the field value is beyond the specified range, the effect of the boost drops off. The higher the importance, the faster the effect drops off. If you don’t specify a value, the default is 3 months. The value of the field is a numeric string followed by the character “s”, for example “86400s” for one day, or “604800s” for one week.\n\nOnly applies to DATE fields.\n\nRankOrder -> (string)\n\nDetermines how values should be interpreted.\n\nWhen the RankOrder field is ASCENDING , higher numbers are better. For example, a document with a rating score of 10 is higher ranking than a document with a rating score of 1.\n\nWhen the RankOrder field is DESCENDING , lower numbers are better. For example, in a task tracking application, a priority 1 task is more important than a priority 5 task.\n\nOnly applies to LONG and DOUBLE fields.\n\nValueImportanceMap -> (map)\n\nA list of values that should be given a different boost when they appear in the result list. For example, if you are boosting a field called “department,” query terms that match the department field are boosted in the result. However, you can add entries from the department field to boost documents with those values higher.\n\nFor example, you can add entries to the map with names of departments. If you add “HR”,5 and “Legal”,3 those departments are given special attention when they appear in the metadata of a document. When those terms appear they are given the specified importance instead of the regular importance for the boost.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (integer)\n\nSearch -> (structure)\n\nProvides information about how the field is used during a search.\n\nFacetable -> (boolean)\n\nIndicates that the field can be used to create search facets, a count of results for each value in the field. The default is false .\n\nSearchable -> (boolean)\n\nDetermines whether the field is used in the search. If the Searchable field is true , you can use relevance tuning to manually tune how Amazon Kendra weights the field in the search. The default is true for string fields and false for number and date fields.\n\nDisplayable -> (boolean)\n\nDetermines whether the field is returned in the query response. The default is true .\n\nSortable -> (boolean)\n\nDetermines whether the field can be used to sort the results of a query. If you specify sorting on a field that does not have Sortable set to true , Amazon Kendra returns an exception. The default is false .\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nName=string,Type=string,Relevance={Freshness=boolean,Importance=integer,Duration=string,RankOrder=string,ValueImportanceMap={KeyName1=integer,KeyName2=integer}},Search={Facetable=boolean,Searchable=boolean,Displayable=boolean,Sortable=boolean} ...\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Name\": \"string\",\n    \"Type\": \"STRING_VALUE\"|\"STRING_LIST_VALUE\"|\"LONG_VALUE\"|\"DATE_VALUE\",\n    \"Relevance\": {\n      \"Freshness\": true|false,\n      \"Importance\": integer,\n      \"Duration\": \"string\",\n      \"RankOrder\": \"ASCENDING\"|\"DESCENDING\",\n      \"ValueImportanceMap\": {\"string\": integer\n        ...}\n    },\n    \"Search\": {\n      \"Facetable\": true|false,\n      \"Searchable\": true|false,\n      \"Displayable\": true|false,\n      \"Sortable\": true|false\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--capacity-units (structure)\n\nSets the number of additional storage and query capacity units that should be used by the index. You can change the capacity of the index up to 5 times per day.\n\nIf you are using extra storage units, you can’t reduce the storage capacity below that required to meet the storage needs for your index.\n\nStorageCapacityUnits -> (integer)\n\nThe amount of extra storage capacity for an index. A single capacity unit provides 30 GB of storage space or 100,000 documents, whichever is reached first.\n\nQueryCapacityUnits -> (integer)\n\nThe amount of extra query capacity for an index and GetQuerySuggestions capacity.\n\nA single extra capacity unit for an index provides 0.1 queries per second or approximately 8,000 queries per day.\n\nGetQuerySuggestions capacity is five times the provisioned query capacity for an index, or the base capacity of 2.5 calls per second, whichever is higher. For example, the base capacity for an index is 0.1 queries per second, and GetQuerySuggestions capacity has a base of 2.5 calls per second. If you add another 0.1 queries per second to total 0.2 queries per second for an index, the GetQuerySuggestions capacity is 2.5 calls per second (higher than five times 0.2 queries per second).\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nStorageCapacityUnits=integer,QueryCapacityUnits=integer\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"StorageCapacityUnits\": integer,\n  \"QueryCapacityUnits\": integer\n}\n\n\n--user-token-configurations (list)\n\nThe user token configuration.\n\n(structure)\n\nProvides configuration information for a token configuration.\n\nJwtTokenTypeConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nInformation about the JWT token type configuration.\n\nKeyLocation -> (string)\n\nThe location of the key.\n\nURL -> (string)\n\nThe signing key URL.\n\nSecretManagerArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (arn) of the secret.\n\nUserNameAttributeField -> (string)\n\nThe user name attribute field.\n\nGroupAttributeField -> (string)\n\nThe group attribute field.\n\nIssuer -> (string)\n\nThe issuer of the token.\n\nClaimRegex -> (string)\n\nThe regular expression that identifies the claim.\n\nJsonTokenTypeConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nInformation about the JSON token type configuration.\n\nUserNameAttributeField -> (string)\n\nThe user name attribute field.\n\nGroupAttributeField -> (string)\n\nThe group attribute field.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nJwtTokenTypeConfiguration={KeyLocation=string,URL=string,SecretManagerArn=string,UserNameAttributeField=string,GroupAttributeField=string,Issuer=string,ClaimRegex=string},JsonTokenTypeConfiguration={UserNameAttributeField=string,GroupAttributeField=string} ...\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"JwtTokenTypeConfiguration\": {\n      \"KeyLocation\": \"URL\"|\"SECRET_MANAGER\",\n      \"URL\": \"string\",\n      \"SecretManagerArn\": \"string\",\n      \"UserNameAttributeField\": \"string\",\n      \"GroupAttributeField\": \"string\",\n      \"Issuer\": \"string\",\n      \"ClaimRegex\": \"string\"\n    },\n    \"JsonTokenTypeConfiguration\": {\n      \"UserNameAttributeField\": \"string\",\n      \"GroupAttributeField\": \"string\"\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--user-context-policy (string)\n\nThe user context policy.\n\nPossible values:\n\nATTRIBUTE_FILTER\n\nUSER_TOKEN\n\n--user-group-resolution-configuration (structure)\n\nEnables fetching access levels of groups and users from an AWS Single Sign-On identity source.
