Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a checksum to make sure your key was not corrupted in transit. The key MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes long before being base64-encoded.\n\nInitializationVector -> (string)\n\nThe series of random bits created by a random bit generator, unique for every encryption operation, that you used to encrypt your input files or that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your output files. The initialization vector must be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes long before being base64-encoded.\n\nTimeSpan -> (structure)\n\nSettings for clipping an input. Each input can have different clip settings.\n\nStartTime -> (string)\n\nThe place in the input file where you want a clip to start. The format can be either HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don’t specify a value, Elastic Transcoder starts at the beginning of the input file.\n\nDuration -> (string)\n\nThe duration of the clip. The format can be either HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don’t specify a value, Elastic Transcoder creates an output file from StartTime to the end of the file.\n\nIf you specify a value longer than the duration of the input file, Elastic Transcoder transcodes the file and returns a warning message.\n\nInputCaptions -> (structure)\n\nYou can configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions, or subtitles, from one format to another. All captions must be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two types of captions:\n\nEmbedded: Embedded captions are included in the same file as the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder supports only one embedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300 embedded captions per file. Valid input values include: CEA-608 (EIA-608 , first non-empty channel only), CEA-708 (EIA-708 , first non-empty channel only), and mov-text Valid outputs include: mov-text Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one embedded format per output.\n\nSidecar: Sidecar captions are kept in a separate metadata file from the audio and video data. Sidecar captions require a player that is capable of understanding the relationship between the video file and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file. Valid input values include: dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt , scc , smpt , srt , ttml (first div element only), and webvtt Valid outputs include: dfxp (first div element only), scc , srt , and webvtt .\n\nIf you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as your output format.\n\nElastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Character Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for captions, and is not available for audio-only transcoding. Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, italics) during the transcoding process.\n\nTo remove captions or leave the captions empty, set Captions to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and pass in a null CaptionSources array.\n\nFor more information on embedded files, see the Subtitles Wikipedia page.\n\nFor more information on sidecar files, see the Extensible Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.\n\nMergePolicy -> (string)\n\nA policy that determines how Elastic Transcoder handles the existence of multiple captions.\n\nMergeOverride: Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and ignores the embedded captions for that language.\n\nMergeRetain: Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the embedded captions and ignores the sidecar captions for that language. If CaptionSources is empty, Elastic Transcoder omits all sidecar captions from the output files.\n\nOverride: Elastic Transcoder transcodes only the sidecar captions that you specify in CaptionSources .\n\nMergePolicy cannot be null.\n\nCaptionSources -> (list)\n\nSource files for the input sidecar captions used during the transcoding process.

We recommend that the name be unique within the AWS account, but uniqueness is not enforced.\n\n--description (string)\n\nA description of the preset.\n\n--container (string)\n\nThe container type for the output file. Valid values include flac , flv , fmp4 , gif , mp3 , mp4 , mpg , mxf , oga , ogg , ts , and webm .\n\n--video (structure)\n\nA section of the request body that specifies the video parameters.\n\nCodec -> (string)\n\nThe video codec for the output file. Valid values include gif , H.264 , mpeg2 , vp8 , and vp9 . You can only specify vp8 and vp9 when the container type is webm , gif when the container type is gif , and mpeg2 when the container type is mpg .\n\nCodecOptions -> (map)\n\nProfile (H.264/VP8/VP9 Only)\n\nThe H.264 profile that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:\n\nbaseline : The profile most commonly used for videoconferencing and for mobile applications.\n\nmain : The profile used for standard-definition digital TV broadcasts.\n\nhigh : The profile used for high-definition digital TV broadcasts and for Blu-ray discs.\n\nLevel (H.264 Only)\n\nThe H.264 level that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following levels:\n\n1 , 1b , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 2 , 2.1 , 2.2 , 3 , 3.1 , 3.2 , 4 , 4.1\n\nMaxReferenceFrames (H.264 Only)\n\nApplicable only when the value of Video:Codec is H.264. The maximum number of previously decoded frames to use as a reference for decoding future frames. Valid values are integers 0 through 16, but we recommend that you not use a value greater than the following:\n\nMin(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256 / (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)\n\nwhere Width in pixels and Height in pixels represent either MaxWidth and MaxHeight, or Resolution. Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks depends on the value of the Level object. See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of pixels measuring 16x16.)\n\n1 - 396\n\n1b - 396\n\n1.1 - 900\n\n1.2 - 2376\n\n1.3 - 2376\n\n2 - 2376\n\n2.1 - 4752\n\n2.2 - 8100\n\n3 - 8100\n\n3.1 - 18000\n\n3.2 - 20480\n\n4 - 32768\n\n4.1 - 32768\n\nMaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)\n\nThe maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer; the size of the buffer is specified by BufferSize . Specify a value between 16 and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required to stream a video by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also reduces the quality of the video.\n\nBufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)\n\nThe maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output video. This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment duration when you’re using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the container type of the output video. Specify an integer greater than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize , Elastic Transcoder sets BufferSize to 10 times the value of MaxBitRate .\n\nInterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)\n\nThe interlace mode for the output video.\n\nInterlaced video is used to double the perceived frame rate for a video by interlacing two fields (one field on every other line, the other field on the other lines) so that the human eye registers multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing reduces the bandwidth required for transmitting a video, but can result in blurred images and flickering.\n\nValid values include Progressive (no interlacing, top to bottom), TopFirst (top field first), BottomFirst (bottom field first), and Auto .\n\nIf InterlaceMode is not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses Progressive for the output. If Auto is specified, Elastic Transcoder interlaces the output.\n\nColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)\n\nThe color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to the output video. Color spaces are the algorithms used by the computer to store information about how to render color. Bt.601 is the standard for standard definition video, while Bt.709 is the standard for high definition video.\n\nValid values include None , Bt709toBt601 , Bt601toBt709 , and Auto .\n\nIf you chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode and your output is interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 50 , or 60 , your SegmentDuration is null, and you are using one of the resolution changes from the list below, Elastic Transcoder applies the following color space conversions:\n\nStandard to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709\n\nStandard to HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709\n\nHD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601\n\nHD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601\n\nNote\n\nElastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the ColorspaceConversionMode Auto mode in the future. All outputs in a playlist must use the same ColorSpaceConversionMode .\n\nIf you do not specify a ColorSpaceConversionMode , Elastic Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If you are unsure what ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied to your output file, you can check the AppliedColorSpaceConversion parameter included in your job response. If your job does not have an AppliedColorSpaceConversion in its response, no ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied.\n\nChromaSubsampling\n\nThe sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the output video. Valid values include yuv420p and yuv422p .\n\nyuv420p samples the chroma information of every other horizontal and every other vertical line, yuv422p samples the color information of every horizontal line and every other vertical line.\n\nLoopCount (Gif Only)\n\nThe number of times you want the output gif to loop. Valid values include Infinite and integers between 0 and 100 , inclusive.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nKeyframesMaxDist -> (string)\n\nApplicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .\n\nThe maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are fully encoded frames; the frames between key frames are encoded based, in part, on the content of the key frames. The value is an integer formatted as a string; valid values are between 1 (every frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher value results in higher compression but may also discernibly decrease video quality.\n\nFor Smooth outputs, the FrameRate must have a constant ratio to the KeyframesMaxDist . This allows Smooth playlists to switch between different quality levels while the file is being played.\n\nFor example, an input file can have a FrameRate of 30 with a KeyframesMaxDist of 90. The output file then needs to have a ratio of 1:3. Valid outputs would have FrameRate of 30, 25, and 10, and KeyframesMaxDist of 90, 75, and 30, respectively.\n\nAlternately, this can be achieved by setting FrameRate to auto and having the same values for MaxFrameRate and KeyframesMaxDist .\n\nFixedGOP -> (string)\n\nApplicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .\n\nWhether to use a fixed value for FixedGOP . Valid values are true and false :\n\ntrue : Elastic Transcoder uses the value of KeyframesMaxDist for the distance between key frames (the number of frames in a group of pictures, or GOP).\n\nfalse : The distance between key frames can vary.\n\nWarning\n\nFixedGOP must be set to true for fmp4 containers.\n\nBitRate -> (string)\n\nThe bit rate of the video stream in the output file, in kilobits/second. Valid values depend on the values of Level and Profile . If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses the detected bit rate of the input source. If you specify a value other than auto , we recommend that you specify a value less than or equal to the maximum H.264-compliant value listed for your level and profile:\n\nLevel - Maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (baseline and main Profile) : maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (high Profile)\n\n1 - 64 : 80\n\n1b - 128 : 160\n\n1.1 - 192 : 240\n\n1.2 - 384 : 480\n\n1.3 - 768 : 960\n\n2 - 2000 : 2500\n\n3 - 10000 : 12500\n\n3.1 - 14000 : 17500\n\n3.2 - 20000 : 25000\n\n4 - 20000 : 25000\n\n4.1 - 50000 : 62500\n\nFrameRate -> (string)\n\nThe frames per second for the video stream in the output file. Valid values include:\n\nauto , 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60\n\nIf you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses the detected frame rate of the input source. If you specify a frame rate, we recommend that you perform the following calculation:\n\nFrame rate = maximum recommended decoding speed in luma samples/second / (width in pixels * height in pixels)\n\nwhere:\n\nwidth in pixels and height in pixels represent the Resolution of the output video.\n\nmaximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second is less than or equal to the maximum value listed in the following table, based on the value that you specified for Level.\n\nThe maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second for each level is described in the following list (Level - Decoding speed ):\n\n1 - 380160\n\n1b - 380160\n\n1.1 - 76800\n\n1.2 - 1536000\n\n1.3 - 3041280\n\n2 - 3041280\n\n2.1 - 5068800\n\n2.2 - 5184000\n\n3 - 10368000\n\n3.1 - 27648000\n\n3.2 - 55296000\n\n4 - 62914560\n\n4.1 - 62914560\n\nMaxFrameRate -> (string)\n\nIf you specify auto for FrameRate , Elastic Transcoder uses the frame rate of the input video for the frame rate of the output video. Specify the maximum frame rate that you want Elastic Transcoder to use when the frame rate of the input video is greater than the desired maximum frame rate of the output video. Valid values include: 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60 .\n\nResolution -> (string)\n\nWarning\n\nTo better control resolution and aspect ratio of output videos, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth , MaxHeight , SizingPolicy , PaddingPolicy , and DisplayAspectRatio instead of Resolution and AspectRatio . The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.\n\nThe width and height of the video in the output file, in pixels. Valid values are auto and width x height :\n\nauto : Elastic Transcoder attempts to preserve the width and height of the input file, subject to the following rules.\n\n``width x height `` : The width and height of the output video in pixels.\n\nNote the following about specifying the width and height:\n\nThe width must be an even integer between 128 and 4096, inclusive.\n\nThe height must be an even integer between 96 and 3072, inclusive.\n\nIf you specify a resolution that is less than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output file to the lower resolution.\n\nIf you specify a resolution that is greater than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output to the higher resolution.\n\nWe recommend that you specify a resolution for which the product of width and height is less than or equal to the applicable value in the following list (List - Max width x height value ):\n\n1 - 25344\n\n1b - 25344\n\n1.1 - 101376\n\n1.2 - 101376\n\n1.3 - 101376\n\n2 - 101376\n\n2.1 - 202752\n\n2.2 - 404720\n\n3 - 404720\n\n3.1 - 921600\n\n3.2 - 1310720\n\n4 - 2097152\n\n4.1 - 2097152\n\nAspectRatio -> (string)\n\nWarning\n\nTo better control resolution and aspect ratio of output videos, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth , MaxHeight , SizingPolicy , PaddingPolicy , and DisplayAspectRatio instead of Resolution and AspectRatio . The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.\n\nThe display aspect ratio of the video in the output file. Valid values include:\n\nauto , 1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9\n\nIf you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder tries to preserve the aspect ratio of the input file.\n\nIf you specify an aspect ratio for the output file that differs from aspect ratio of the input file, Elastic Transcoder adds pillarboxing (black bars on the sides) or letterboxing (black bars on the top and bottom) to maintain the aspect ratio of the active region of the video.\n\nMaxWidth -> (string)\n\nThe maximum width of the output video in pixels. If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses 1920 (Full HD) as the default value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer between 128 and 4096.\n\nMaxHeight -> (string)\n\nThe maximum height of the output video in pixels. If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as the default value.

You can only specify vp8 and vp9 when the container type is webm , gif when the container type is gif , and mpeg2 when the container type is mpg .\n\nCodecOptions -> (map)\n\nProfile (H.264/VP8/VP9 Only)\n\nThe H.264 profile that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:\n\nbaseline : The profile most commonly used for videoconferencing and for mobile applications.\n\nmain : The profile used for standard-definition digital TV broadcasts.\n\nhigh : The profile used for high-definition digital TV broadcasts and for Blu-ray discs.\n\nLevel (H.264 Only)\n\nThe H.264 level that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following levels:\n\n1 , 1b , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 2 , 2.1 , 2.2 , 3 , 3.1 , 3.2 , 4 , 4.1\n\nMaxReferenceFrames (H.264 Only)\n\nApplicable only when the value of Video:Codec is H.264. The maximum number of previously decoded frames to use as a reference for decoding future frames. Valid values are integers 0 through 16, but we recommend that you not use a value greater than the following:\n\nMin(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256 / (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)\n\nwhere Width in pixels and Height in pixels represent either MaxWidth and MaxHeight, or Resolution. Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks depends on the value of the Level object. See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of pixels measuring 16x16.)\n\n1 - 396\n\n1b - 396\n\n1.1 - 900\n\n1.2 - 2376\n\n1.3 - 2376\n\n2 - 2376\n\n2.1 - 4752\n\n2.2 - 8100\n\n3 - 8100\n\n3.1 - 18000\n\n3.2 - 20480\n\n4 - 32768\n\n4.1 - 32768\n\nMaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)\n\nThe maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer; the size of the buffer is specified by BufferSize . Specify a value between 16 and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required to stream a video by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also reduces the quality of the video.\n\nBufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)\n\nThe maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output video. This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment duration when you’re using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the container type of the output video. Specify an integer greater than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize , Elastic Transcoder sets BufferSize to 10 times the value of MaxBitRate .\n\nInterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)\n\nThe interlace mode for the output video.\n\nInterlaced video is used to double the perceived frame rate for a video by interlacing two fields (one field on every other line, the other field on the other lines) so that the human eye registers multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing reduces the bandwidth required for transmitting a video, but can result in blurred images and flickering.\n\nValid values include Progressive (no interlacing, top to bottom), TopFirst (top field first), BottomFirst (bottom field first), and Auto .\n\nIf InterlaceMode is not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses Progressive for the output. If Auto is specified, Elastic Transcoder interlaces the output.\n\nColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)\n\nThe color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to the output video. Color spaces are the algorithms used by the computer to store information about how to render color. Bt.601 is the standard for standard definition video, while Bt.709 is the standard for high definition video.\n\nValid values include None , Bt709toBt601 , Bt601toBt709 , and Auto .\n\nIf you chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode and your output is interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 50 , or 60 , your SegmentDuration is null, and you are using one of the resolution changes from the list below, Elastic Transcoder applies the following color space conversions:\n\nStandard to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709\n\nStandard to HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709\n\nHD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601\n\nHD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601\n\nNote\n\nElastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the ColorspaceConversionMode Auto mode in the future. All outputs in a playlist must use the same ColorSpaceConversionMode .\n\nIf you do not specify a ColorSpaceConversionMode , Elastic Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If you are unsure what ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied to your output file, you can check the AppliedColorSpaceConversion parameter included in your job response. If your job does not have an AppliedColorSpaceConversion in its response, no ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied.\n\nChromaSubsampling\n\nThe sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the output video. Valid values include yuv420p and yuv422p .\n\nyuv420p samples the chroma information of every other horizontal and every other vertical line, yuv422p samples the color information of every horizontal line and every other vertical line.\n\nLoopCount (Gif Only)\n\nThe number of times you want the output gif to loop. Valid values include Infinite and integers between 0 and 100 , inclusive.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nKeyframesMaxDist -> (string)\n\nApplicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .\n\nThe maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are fully encoded frames; the frames between key frames are encoded based, in part, on the content of the key frames. The value is an integer formatted as a string; valid values are between 1 (every frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher value results in higher compression but may also discernibly decrease video quality.\n\nFor Smooth outputs, the FrameRate must have a constant ratio to the KeyframesMaxDist . This allows Smooth playlists to switch between different quality levels while the file is being played.\n\nFor example, an input file can have a FrameRate of 30 with a KeyframesMaxDist of 90. The output file then needs to have a ratio of 1:3. Valid outputs would have FrameRate of 30, 25, and 10, and KeyframesMaxDist of 90, 75, and 30, respectively.\n\nAlternately, this can be achieved by setting FrameRate to auto and having the same values for MaxFrameRate and KeyframesMaxDist .\n\nFixedGOP -> (string)\n\nApplicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .\n\nWhether to use a fixed value for FixedGOP . Valid values are true and false :\n\ntrue : Elastic Transcoder uses the value of KeyframesMaxDist for the distance between key frames (the number of frames in a group of pictures, or GOP).\n\nfalse : The distance between key frames can vary.\n\nWarning\n\nFixedGOP must be set to true for fmp4 containers.\n\nBitRate -> (string)\n\nThe bit rate of the video stream in the output file, in kilobits/second. Valid values depend on the values of Level and Profile . If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses the detected bit rate of the input source. If you specify a value other than auto , we recommend that you specify a value less than or equal to the maximum H.264-compliant value listed for your level and profile:\n\nLevel - Maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (baseline and main Profile) : maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (high Profile)\n\n1 - 64 : 80\n\n1b - 128 : 160\n\n1.1 - 192 : 240\n\n1.2 - 384 : 480\n\n1.3 - 768 : 960\n\n2 - 2000 : 2500\n\n3 - 10000 : 12500\n\n3.1 - 14000 : 17500\n\n3.2 - 20000 : 25000\n\n4 - 20000 : 25000\n\n4.1 - 50000 : 62500\n\nFrameRate -> (string)\n\nThe frames per second for the video stream in the output file. Valid values include:\n\nauto , 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60\n\nIf you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses the detected frame rate of the input source. If you specify a frame rate, we recommend that you perform the following calculation:\n\nFrame rate = maximum recommended decoding speed in luma samples/second / (width in pixels * height in pixels)\n\nwhere:\n\nwidth in pixels and height in pixels represent the Resolution of the output video.\n\nmaximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second is less than or equal to the maximum value listed in the following table, based on the value that you specified for Level.\n\nThe maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second for each level is described in the following list (Level - Decoding speed ):\n\n1 - 380160\n\n1b - 380160\n\n1.1 - 76800\n\n1.2 - 1536000\n\n1.3 - 3041280\n\n2 - 3041280\n\n2.1 - 5068800\n\n2.2 - 5184000\n\n3 - 10368000\n\n3.1 - 27648000\n\n3.2 - 55296000\n\n4 - 62914560\n\n4.1 - 62914560\n\nMaxFrameRate -> (string)\n\nIf you specify auto for FrameRate , Elastic Transcoder uses the frame rate of the input video for the frame rate of the output video. Specify the maximum frame rate that you want Elastic Transcoder to use when the frame rate of the input video is greater than the desired maximum frame rate of the output video. Valid values include: 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60 .\n\nResolution -> (string)\n\nWarning\n\nTo better control resolution and aspect ratio of output videos, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth , MaxHeight , SizingPolicy , PaddingPolicy , and DisplayAspectRatio instead of Resolution and AspectRatio . The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.\n\nThe width and height of the video in the output file, in pixels. Valid values are auto and width x height :\n\nauto : Elastic Transcoder attempts to preserve the width and height of the input file, subject to the following rules.\n\n``width x height `` : The width and height of the output video in pixels.\n\nNote the following about specifying the width and height:\n\nThe width must be an even integer between 128 and 4096, inclusive.\n\nThe height must be an even integer between 96 and 3072, inclusive.\n\nIf you specify a resolution that is less than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output file to the lower resolution.\n\nIf you specify a resolution that is greater than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output to the higher resolution.\n\nWe recommend that you specify a resolution for which the product of width and height is less than or equal to the applicable value in the following list (List - Max width x height value ):\n\n1 - 25344\n\n1b - 25344\n\n1.1 - 101376\n\n1.2 - 101376\n\n1.3 - 101376\n\n2 - 101376\n\n2.1 - 202752\n\n2.2 - 404720\n\n3 - 404720\n\n3.1 - 921600\n\n3.2 - 1310720\n\n4 - 2097152\n\n4.1 - 2097152\n\nAspectRatio -> (string)\n\nWarning\n\nTo better control resolution and aspect ratio of output videos, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth , MaxHeight , SizingPolicy , PaddingPolicy , and DisplayAspectRatio instead of Resolution and AspectRatio .

Elastic Transcoder centers the output video and then crops it in the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.\n\nStretch : Elastic Transcoder stretches the output video to match the values that you specified for MaxWidth and MaxHeight . If the relative proportions of the input video and the output video are different, the output video will be distorted.\n\nKeep : Elastic Transcoder does not scale the output video.

If your input file is encrypted, you must specify the mode that Elastic Transcoder uses to decrypt your file.\n\nMode -> (string)\n\nThe specific server-side encryption mode that you want Elastic Transcoder to use when decrypting your input files or encrypting your output files. Elastic Transcoder supports the following options:\n\ns3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used for encrypting your files.\n\ns3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key Management Service, which creates and manages the keys that are used for encrypting your files. If you specify s3-aws-kms and you don’t want to use the default key, you must add the AWS-KMS key that you want to use to your pipeline.\n\naes-cbc-pkcs7: A padded cipher-block mode of operation originally used for HLS files.\n\naes-ctr: AES Counter Mode.\n\naes-gcm: AES Galois Counter Mode, a mode of operation that is an authenticated encryption format, meaning that a file, key, or initialization vector that has been tampered with fails the decryption process.\n\nFor all three AES options, you must provide the following settings, which must be base64-encoded:\n\nKey\n\nKey MD5\n\nInitialization Vector\n\nWarning\n\nFor the AES modes, your private encryption keys and your unencrypted data are never stored by AWS; therefore, it is important that you safely manage your encryption keys. If you lose them, you won’t be able to unencrypt your data.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nThe data encryption key that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file, or that was used to encrypt your input file. The key must be base64-encoded and it must be one of the following bit lengths before being base64-encoded:\n\n128 , 192 , or 256 .\n\nThe key must also be encrypted by using the Amazon Key Management Service.\n\nKeyMd5 -> (string)\n\nThe MD5 digest of the key that you used to encrypt your input file, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your output file. Elastic Transcoder uses the key digest as a checksum to make sure your key was not corrupted in transit. The key MD5 must be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes long before being base64-encoded.\n\nInitializationVector -> (string)\n\nThe series of random bits created by a random bit generator, unique for every encryption operation, that you used to encrypt your input files or that you want Elastic Transcoder to use to encrypt your output files. The initialization vector must be base64-encoded, and it must be exactly 16 bytes long before being base64-encoded.\n\nTimeSpan -> (structure)\n\nSettings for clipping an input. Each input can have different clip settings.\n\nStartTime -> (string)\n\nThe place in the input file where you want a clip to start. The format can be either HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don’t specify a value, Elastic Transcoder starts at the beginning of the input file.\n\nDuration -> (string)\n\nThe duration of the clip. The format can be either HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don’t specify a value, Elastic Transcoder creates an output file from StartTime to the end of the file.\n\nIf you specify a value longer than the duration of the input file, Elastic Transcoder transcodes the file and returns a warning message.\n\nInputCaptions -> (structure)\n\nYou can configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions, or subtitles, from one format to another. All captions must be in UTF-8. Elastic Transcoder supports two types of captions:\n\nEmbedded: Embedded captions are included in the same file as the audio and video. Elastic Transcoder supports only one embedded caption per language, to a maximum of 300 embedded captions per file. Valid input values include: CEA-608 (EIA-608 , first non-empty channel only), CEA-708 (EIA-708 , first non-empty channel only), and mov-text Valid outputs include: mov-text Elastic Transcoder supports a maximum of one embedded format per output.\n\nSidecar: Sidecar captions are kept in a separate metadata file from the audio and video data. Sidecar captions require a player that is capable of understanding the relationship between the video file and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file. Valid input values include: dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt , scc , smpt , srt , ttml (first div element only), and webvtt Valid outputs include: dfxp (first div element only), scc , srt , and webvtt .\n\nIf you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as your output format.\n\nElastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Character Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for captions, and is not available for audio-only transcoding. Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, italics) during the transcoding process.\n\nTo remove captions or leave the captions empty, set Captions to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and pass in a null CaptionSources array.\n\nFor more information on embedded files, see the Subtitles Wikipedia page.\n\nFor more information on sidecar files, see the Extensible Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.\n\nMergePolicy -> (string)\n\nA policy that determines how Elastic Transcoder handles the existence of multiple captions.\n\nMergeOverride: Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and ignores the embedded captions for that language.\n\nMergeRetain: Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the embedded captions and ignores the sidecar captions for that language. If CaptionSources is empty, Elastic Transcoder omits all sidecar captions from the output files.\n\nOverride: Elastic Transcoder transcodes only the sidecar captions that you specify in CaptionSources .\n\nMergePolicy cannot be null.\n\nCaptionSources -> (list)\n\nSource files for the input sidecar captions used during the transcoding process. To omit all sidecar captions, leave CaptionSources blank.\n\n(structure)\n\nA source file for the input sidecar captions used during the transcoding process.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nThe name of the sidecar caption file that you want Elastic Transcoder to include in the output file.\n\nLanguage -> (string)\n\nA string that specifies the language of the caption. If you specified multiple inputs with captions, the caption language must match in order to be included in the output. Specify this as one of:\n\n2-character ISO 639-1 code\n\n3-character ISO 639-2 code\n\nFor more information on ISO language codes and language names, see the List of ISO 639-1 codes.\n\nTimeOffset -> (string)\n\nFor clip generation or captions that do not start at the same time as the associated video file, the TimeOffset tells Elastic Transcoder how much of the video to encode before including captions.\n\nSpecify the TimeOffset in the form [+-]SS.sss or [+-]HH:mm:SS.ss.\n\nLabel -> (string)\n\nThe label of the caption shown in the player when choosing a language. We recommend that you put the caption language name here, in the language of the captions.\n\nEncryption -> (structure)\n\nThe encryption settings, if any, that Elastic Transcoder needs to decyrpt your caption sources, or that you want Elastic Transcoder to apply to your caption sources.\n\nMode -> (string)\n\nThe specific server-side encryption mode that you want Elastic Transcoder to use when decrypting your input files or encrypting your output files. Elastic Transcoder supports the following options:\n\ns3: Amazon S3 creates and manages the keys used for encrypting your files.\n\ns3-aws-kms: Amazon S3 calls the Amazon Key Management Service, which creates and manages the keys that are used for encrypting your files.

All jobs in a playlist must have the same clip settings.\n\nTimeSpan -> (structure)\n\nSettings that determine when a clip begins and how long it lasts.\n\nStartTime -> (string)\n\nThe place in the input file where you want a clip to start. The format can be either HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don’t specify a value, Elastic Transcoder starts at the beginning of the input file.\n\nDuration -> (string)\n\nThe duration of the clip. The format can be either HH:mm:ss.SSS (maximum value: 23:59:59.999; SSS is thousandths of a second) or sssss.SSS (maximum value: 86399.999). If you don’t specify a value, Elastic Transcoder creates an output file from StartTime to the end of the file.\n\nIf you specify a value longer than the duration of the input file, Elastic Transcoder transcodes the file and returns a warning message.\n\nCaptions -> (structure)\n\nYou can configure Elastic Transcoder to transcode captions, or subtitles, from one format to another.

Sidecar captions require a player that is capable of understanding the relationship between the video file and the sidecar file. Elastic Transcoder supports only one sidecar caption per language, to a maximum of 20 sidecar captions per file. Valid input values include: dfxp (first div element only), ebu-tt , scc , smpt , srt , ttml (first div element only), and webvtt Valid outputs include: dfxp (first div element only), scc , srt , and webvtt .\n\nIf you want ttml or smpte-tt compatible captions, specify dfxp as your output format.\n\nElastic Transcoder does not support OCR (Optical Character Recognition), does not accept pictures as a valid input for captions, and is not available for audio-only transcoding. Elastic Transcoder does not preserve text formatting (for example, italics) during the transcoding process.\n\nTo remove captions or leave the captions empty, set Captions to null. To pass through existing captions unchanged, set the MergePolicy to MergeRetain , and pass in a null CaptionSources array.\n\nFor more information on embedded files, see the Subtitles Wikipedia page.\n\nFor more information on sidecar files, see the Extensible Metadata Platform and Sidecar file Wikipedia pages.\n\nMergePolicy -> (string)\n\nA policy that determines how Elastic Transcoder handles the existence of multiple captions.\n\nMergeOverride: Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the sidecar captions and ignores the embedded captions for that language.\n\nMergeRetain: Elastic Transcoder transcodes both embedded and sidecar captions into outputs. If captions for a language are embedded in the input file and also appear in a sidecar file, Elastic Transcoder uses the embedded captions and ignores the sidecar captions for that language.

You can specify up to four watermarks for each output. Settings for each watermark must be defined in the preset that you specify in Preset for the current output.\n\nWatermarks are added to the output video in the sequence in which you list them in the job output—the first watermark in the list is added to the output video first, the second watermark in the list is added next, and so on. As a result, if the settings in a preset cause Elastic Transcoder to place all watermarks in the same location, the second watermark that you add covers the first one, the third one covers the second, and the fourth one covers the third.\n\n(structure)\n\nWatermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to display a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png format, which supports transparency.\n\nPresetWatermarkId -> (string)\n\nThe ID of the watermark settings that Elastic Transcoder uses to add watermarks to the video during transcoding. The settings are in the preset specified by Preset for the current output. In that preset, the value of Watermarks Id tells Elastic Transcoder which settings to use.\n\nInputKey -> (string)\n\nThe name of the .png or .jpg file that you want to use for the watermark. To determine which Amazon S3 bucket contains the specified file, Elastic Transcoder checks the pipeline specified by Pipeline ; the Input Bucket object in that pipeline identifies the bucket.\n\nIf the file name includes a prefix, for example, logos/128x64.png , include the prefix in the key.

You can also use the Elastic Transcoder system presets, which you can get with ListPresets .\n\nSegmentDuration -> (string)\n\nWarning\n\n(Outputs in Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS format only.\n\nIf you specify a preset in PresetId for which the value of Container is fmp4 (Fragmented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS), SegmentDuration is the target maximum duration of each segment in seconds. For HLSv3 format playlists, each media segment is stored in a separate .ts file. For HLSv4 , MPEG-DASH , and Smooth playlists, all media segments for an output are stored in a single file. Each segment is approximately the length of the SegmentDuration , though individual segments might be shorter or longer.\n\nThe range of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds. If the duration of the video is not evenly divisible by SegmentDuration , the duration of the last segment is the remainder of total length/SegmentDuration.\n\nElastic Transcoder creates an output-specific playlist for each output HLS output that you specify in OutputKeys. To add an output to the master playlist for this job, include it in the OutputKeys of the associated playlist.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nThe status of one output in a job. If you specified only one output for the job, Outputs:Status is always the same as Job:Status . If you specified more than one output:\n\nJob:Status and Outputs:Status for all of the outputs is Submitted until Elastic Transcoder starts to process the first output.\n\nWhen Elastic Transcoder starts to process the first output, Outputs:Status for that output and Job:Status both change to Progressing. For each output, the value of Outputs:Status remains Submitted until Elastic Transcoder starts to process the output.\n\nJob:Status remains Progressing until all of the outputs reach a terminal status, either Complete or Error.\n\nWhen all of the outputs reach a terminal status, Job:Status changes to Complete only if Outputs:Status for all of the outputs is Complete . If Outputs:Status for one or more outputs is Error , the terminal status for Job:Status is also Error .\n\nThe value of Status is one of the following: Submitted , Progressing , Complete , Canceled , or Error .\n\nStatusDetail -> (string)\n\nInformation that further explains Status .\n\nDuration -> (long)\n\nDuration of the output file, in seconds.\n\nWidth -> (integer)\n\nSpecifies the width of the output file in pixels.\n\nHeight -> (integer)\n\nHeight of the output file, in pixels.\n\nFrameRate -> (string)\n\nFrame rate of the output file, in frames per second.\n\nFileSize -> (long)\n\nFile size of the output file, in bytes.\n\nDurationMillis -> (long)\n\nDuration of the output file, in milliseconds.\n\nWatermarks -> (list)\n\nInformation about the watermarks that you want Elastic Transcoder to add to the video during transcoding. You can specify up to four watermarks for each output. Settings for each watermark must be defined in the preset that you specify in Preset for the current output.\n\nWatermarks are added to the output video in the sequence in which you list them in the job output—the first watermark in the list is added to the output video first, the second watermark in the list is added next, and so on. As a result, if the settings in a preset cause Elastic Transcoder to place all watermarks in the same location, the second watermark that you add covers the first one, the third one covers the second, and the fourth one covers the third.\n\n(structure)\n\nWatermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to display a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png format, which supports transparency.\n\nPresetWatermarkId -> (string)\n\nThe ID of the watermark settings that Elastic Transcoder uses to add watermarks to the video during transcoding. The settings are in the preset specified by Preset for the current output. In that preset, the value of Watermarks Id tells Elastic Transcoder which settings to use.\n\nInputKey -> (string)\n\nThe name of the .png or .jpg file that you want to use for the watermark. To determine which Amazon S3 bucket contains the specified file, Elastic Transcoder checks the pipeline specified by Pipeline ; the Input Bucket object in that pipeline identifies the bucket.\n\nIf the file name includes a prefix, for example, logos/128x64.png , include the prefix in the key.

You can also use the Elastic Transcoder system presets, which you can get with ListPresets .\n\nSegmentDuration -> (string)\n\nWarning\n\n(Outputs in Fragmented MP4 or MPEG-TS format only.\n\nIf you specify a preset in PresetId for which the value of Container is fmp4 (Fragmented MP4) or ts (MPEG-TS), SegmentDuration is the target maximum duration of each segment in seconds. For HLSv3 format playlists, each media segment is stored in a separate .ts file. For HLSv4 , MPEG-DASH , and Smooth playlists, all media segments for an output are stored in a single file. Each segment is approximately the length of the SegmentDuration , though individual segments might be shorter or longer.\n\nThe range of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds. If the duration of the video is not evenly divisible by SegmentDuration , the duration of the last segment is the remainder of total length/SegmentDuration.\n\nElastic Transcoder creates an output-specific playlist for each output HLS output that you specify in OutputKeys. To add an output to the master playlist for this job, include it in the OutputKeys of the associated playlist.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nThe status of one output in a job. If you specified only one output for the job, Outputs:Status is always the same as Job:Status . If you specified more than one output:\n\nJob:Status and Outputs:Status for all of the outputs is Submitted until Elastic Transcoder starts to process the first output.\n\nWhen Elastic Transcoder starts to process the first output, Outputs:Status for that output and Job:Status both change to Progressing. For each output, the value of Outputs:Status remains Submitted until Elastic Transcoder starts to process the output.\n\nJob:Status remains Progressing until all of the outputs reach a terminal status, either Complete or Error.\n\nWhen all of the outputs reach a terminal status, Job:Status changes to Complete only if Outputs:Status for all of the outputs is Complete . If Outputs:Status for one or more outputs is Error , the terminal status for Job:Status is also Error .\n\nThe value of Status is one of the following: Submitted , Progressing , Complete , Canceled , or Error .\n\nStatusDetail -> (string)\n\nInformation that further explains Status .\n\nDuration -> (long)\n\nDuration of the output file, in seconds.\n\nWidth -> (integer)\n\nSpecifies the width of the output file in pixels.\n\nHeight -> (integer)\n\nHeight of the output file, in pixels.\n\nFrameRate -> (string)\n\nFrame rate of the output file, in frames per second.\n\nFileSize -> (long)\n\nFile size of the output file, in bytes.\n\nDurationMillis -> (long)\n\nDuration of the output file, in milliseconds.\n\nWatermarks -> (list)\n\nInformation about the watermarks that you want Elastic Transcoder to add to the video during transcoding. You can specify up to four watermarks for each output. Settings for each watermark must be defined in the preset that you specify in Preset for the current output.\n\nWatermarks are added to the output video in the sequence in which you list them in the job output—the first watermark in the list is added to the output video first, the second watermark in the list is added next, and so on. As a result, if the settings in a preset cause Elastic Transcoder to place all watermarks in the same location, the second watermark that you add covers the first one, the third one covers the second, and the fourth one covers the third.\n\n(structure)\n\nWatermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to display a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png format, which supports transparency.\n\nPresetWatermarkId -> (string)\n\nThe ID of the watermark settings that Elastic Transcoder uses to add watermarks to the video during transcoding. The settings are in the preset specified by Preset for the current output. In that preset, the value of Watermarks Id tells Elastic Transcoder which settings to use.\n\nInputKey -> (string)\n\nThe name of the .png or .jpg file that you want to use for the watermark. To determine which Amazon S3 bucket contains the specified file, Elastic Transcoder checks the pipeline specified by Pipeline ; the Input Bucket object in that pipeline identifies the bucket.\n\nIf the file name includes a prefix, for example, logos/128x64.png , include the prefix in the key.

The following values are valid:\n\nauto , 0 , 1 , 2\n\nOne channel carries the information played by a single speaker. For example, a stereo track with two channels sends one channel to the left speaker, and the other channel to the right speaker. The output channels are organized into tracks. If you want Elastic Transcoder to automatically detect the number of audio channels in the input file and use that value for the output file, select auto .\n\nThe output of a specific channel value and inputs are as follows:\n\nauto channel specified, with any input: Pass through up to eight input channels.\n\n0 channels specified, with any input: Audio omitted from the output.\n\n1 channel specified, with at least one input channel: Mono sound.\n\n2 channels specified, with any input: Two identical mono channels or stereo. For more information about tracks, see Audio:AudioPackingMode.\n\nFor more information about how Elastic Transcoder organizes channels and tracks, see Audio:AudioPackingMode .\n\nAudioPackingMode -> (string)\n\nThe method of organizing audio channels and tracks. Use Audio:Channels to specify the number of channels in your output, and Audio:AudioPackingMode to specify the number of tracks and their relation to the channels. If you do not specify an Audio:AudioPackingMode , Elastic Transcoder uses SingleTrack .\n\nThe following values are valid:\n\nSingleTrack , OneChannelPerTrack , and OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks\n\nWhen you specify SingleTrack , Elastic Transcoder creates a single track for your output. The track can have up to eight channels. Use SingleTrack for all non-mxf containers.\n\nThe outputs of SingleTrack for a specific channel value and inputs are as follows:\n\n0 channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output\n\n1, 2, or auto channels with no audio input: Audio omitted from the output\n\n1 channel with any input with audio: One track with one channel, downmixed if necessary\n\n2 channels with one track with one channel: One track with two identical channels\n\n2 or auto channels with two tracks with one channel each: One track with two channels\n\n2 or auto channels with one track with two channels: One track with two channels\n\n2 channels with one track with multiple channels: One track with two channels\n\nauto channels with one track with one channel: One track with one channel\n\nauto channels with one track with multiple channels: One track with multiple channels\n\nWhen you specify OneChannelPerTrack , Elastic Transcoder creates a new track for every channel in your output. Your output can have up to eight single-channel tracks.\n\nThe outputs of OneChannelPerTrack for a specific channel value and inputs are as follows:\n\n0 channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output\n\n1, 2, or auto channels with no audio input: Audio omitted from the output\n\n1 channel with any input with audio: One track with one channel, downmixed if necessary\n\n2 channels with one track with one channel: Two tracks with one identical channel each\n\n2 or auto channels with two tracks with one channel each: Two tracks with one channel each\n\n2 or auto channels with one track with two channels: Two tracks with one channel each\n\n2 channels with one track with multiple channels: Two tracks with one channel each\n\nauto channels with one track with one channel: One track with one channel\n\nauto channels with one track with multiple channels: Up to eight tracks with one channel each\n\nWhen you specify OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks , Elastic Transcoder creates eight single-channel tracks for your output. All tracks that do not contain audio data from an input channel are MOS, or Mit Out Sound, tracks.\n\nThe outputs of OneChannelPerTrackWithMosTo8Tracks for a specific channel value and inputs are as follows:\n\n0 channels with any input: Audio omitted from the output\n\n1, 2, or auto channels with no audio input: Audio omitted from the output\n\n1 channel with any input with audio: One track with one channel, downmixed if necessary, plus six MOS tracks\n\n2 channels with one track with one channel: Two tracks with one identical channel each, plus six MOS tracks\n\n2 or auto channels with two tracks with one channel each: Two tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks\n\n2 or auto channels with one track with two channels: Two tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks\n\n2 channels with one track with multiple channels: Two tracks with one channel each, plus six MOS tracks\n\nauto channels with one track with one channel: One track with one channel, plus seven MOS tracks\n\nauto channels with one track with multiple channels: Up to eight tracks with one channel each, plus MOS tracks until there are eight tracks in all\n\nCodecOptions -> (structure)\n\nIf you specified AAC for Audio:Codec , this is the AAC compression profile to use. Valid values include:\n\nauto , AAC-LC , HE-AAC , HE-AACv2\n\nIf you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder chooses a profile based on the bit rate of the output file.\n\nProfile -> (string)\n\nYou can only choose an audio profile when you specify AAC for the value of Audio:Codec.\n\nSpecify the AAC profile for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:\n\nauto : If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder selects the profile based on the bit rate selected for the output file.\n\nAAC-LC : The most common AAC profile. Use for bit rates larger than 64 kbps.\n\nHE-AAC : Not supported on some older players and devices. Use for bit rates between 40 and 80 kbps.\n\nHE-AACv2 : Not supported on some players and devices. Use for bit rates less than 48 kbps.\n\nAll outputs in a Smooth playlist must have the same value for Profile .\n\nNote\n\nIf you created any presets before AAC profiles were added, Elastic Transcoder automatically updated your presets to use AAC-LC. You can change the value as required.\n\nBitDepth -> (string)\n\nYou can only choose an audio bit depth when you specify flac or pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.\n\nThe bit depth of a sample is how many bits of information are included in the audio samples. The higher the bit depth, the better the audio, but the larger the file.\n\nValid values are 16 and 24 .\n\nThe most common bit depth is 24 .\n\nBitOrder -> (string)\n\nYou can only choose an audio bit order when you specify pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.\n\nThe order the bits of a PCM sample are stored in.\n\nThe supported value is LittleEndian .\n\nSigned -> (string)\n\nYou can only choose whether an audio sample is signed when you specify pcm for the value of Audio:Codec.\n\nWhether audio samples are represented with negative and positive numbers (signed) or only positive numbers (unsigned).\n\nThe supported value is Signed .\n\nVideo -> (structure)\n\nA section of the response body that provides information about the video preset values.\n\nCodec -> (string)\n\nThe video codec for the output file. Valid values include gif , H.264 , mpeg2 , vp8 , and vp9 . You can only specify vp8 and vp9 when the container type is webm , gif when the container type is gif , and mpeg2 when the container type is mpg .\n\nCodecOptions -> (map)\n\nProfile (H.264/VP8/VP9 Only)\n\nThe H.264 profile that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:\n\nbaseline : The profile most commonly used for videoconferencing and for mobile applications.\n\nmain : The profile used for standard-definition digital TV broadcasts.\n\nhigh : The profile used for high-definition digital TV broadcasts and for Blu-ray discs.\n\nLevel (H.264 Only)\n\nThe H.264 level that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following levels:\n\n1 , 1b , 1.1 , 1.2 , 1.3 , 2 , 2.1 , 2.2 , 3 , 3.1 , 3.2 , 4 , 4.1\n\nMaxReferenceFrames (H.264 Only)\n\nApplicable only when the value of Video:Codec is H.264. The maximum number of previously decoded frames to use as a reference for decoding future frames. Valid values are integers 0 through 16, but we recommend that you not use a value greater than the following:\n\nMin(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256 / (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)\n\nwhere Width in pixels and Height in pixels represent either MaxWidth and MaxHeight, or Resolution. Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks depends on the value of the Level object. See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of pixels measuring 16x16.)\n\n1 - 396\n\n1b - 396\n\n1.1 - 900\n\n1.2 - 2376\n\n1.3 - 2376\n\n2 - 2376\n\n2.1 - 4752\n\n2.2 - 8100\n\n3 - 8100\n\n3.1 - 18000\n\n3.2 - 20480\n\n4 - 32768\n\n4.1 - 32768\n\nMaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)\n\nThe maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer; the size of the buffer is specified by BufferSize . Specify a value between 16 and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required to stream a video by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also reduces the quality of the video.\n\nBufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)\n\nThe maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output video. This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment duration when you’re using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the container type of the output video. Specify an integer greater than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize , Elastic Transcoder sets BufferSize to 10 times the value of MaxBitRate .\n\nInterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)\n\nThe interlace mode for the output video.\n\nInterlaced video is used to double the perceived frame rate for a video by interlacing two fields (one field on every other line, the other field on the other lines) so that the human eye registers multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing reduces the bandwidth required for transmitting a video, but can result in blurred images and flickering.\n\nValid values include Progressive (no interlacing, top to bottom), TopFirst (top field first), BottomFirst (bottom field first), and Auto .\n\nIf InterlaceMode is not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses Progressive for the output. If Auto is specified, Elastic Transcoder interlaces the output.\n\nColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)\n\nThe color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to the output video. Color spaces are the algorithms used by the computer to store information about how to render color. Bt.601 is the standard for standard definition video, while Bt.709 is the standard for high definition video.\n\nValid values include None , Bt709toBt601 , Bt601toBt709 , and Auto .\n\nIf you chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode and your output is interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 50 , or 60 , your SegmentDuration is null, and you are using one of the resolution changes from the list below, Elastic Transcoder applies the following color space conversions:\n\nStandard to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709\n\nStandard to HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709\n\nHD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601\n\nHD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601\n\nNote\n\nElastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the ColorspaceConversionMode Auto mode in the future. All outputs in a playlist must use the same ColorSpaceConversionMode .\n\nIf you do not specify a ColorSpaceConversionMode , Elastic Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If you are unsure what ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied to your output file, you can check the AppliedColorSpaceConversion parameter included in your job response. If your job does not have an AppliedColorSpaceConversion in its response, no ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied.\n\nChromaSubsampling\n\nThe sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the output video. Valid values include yuv420p and yuv422p .\n\nyuv420p samples the chroma information of every other horizontal and every other vertical line, yuv422p samples the color information of every horizontal line and every other vertical line.\n\nLoopCount (Gif Only)\n\nThe number of times you want the output gif to loop. Valid values include Infinite and integers between 0 and 100 , inclusive.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nKeyframesMaxDist -> (string)\n\nApplicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .\n\nThe maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are fully encoded frames; the frames between key frames are encoded based, in part, on the content of the key frames. The value is an integer formatted as a string; valid values are between 1 (every frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher value results in higher compression but may also discernibly decrease video quality.\n\nFor Smooth outputs, the FrameRate must have a constant ratio to the KeyframesMaxDist . This allows Smooth playlists to switch between different quality levels while the file is being played.\n\nFor example, an input file can have a FrameRate of 30 with a KeyframesMaxDist of 90. The output file then needs to have a ratio of 1:3. Valid outputs would have FrameRate of 30, 25, and 10, and KeyframesMaxDist of 90, 75, and 30, respectively.\n\nAlternately, this can be achieved by setting FrameRate to auto and having the same values for MaxFrameRate and KeyframesMaxDist .\n\nFixedGOP -> (string)\n\nApplicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .\n\nWhether to use a fixed value for FixedGOP . Valid values are true and false :\n\ntrue : Elastic Transcoder uses the value of KeyframesMaxDist for the distance between key frames (the number of frames in a group of pictures, or GOP).\n\nfalse : The distance between key frames can vary.\n\nWarning\n\nFixedGOP must be set to true for fmp4 containers.\n\nBitRate -> (string)\n\nThe bit rate of the video stream in the output file, in kilobits/second. Valid values depend on the values of Level and Profile . If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses the detected bit rate of the input source. If you specify a value other than auto , we recommend that you specify a value less than or equal to the maximum H.264-compliant value listed for your level and profile:\n\nLevel - Maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (baseline and main Profile) : maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (high Profile)\n\n1 - 64 : 80\n\n1b - 128 : 160\n\n1.1 - 192 : 240\n\n1.2 - 384 : 480\n\n1.3 - 768 : 960\n\n2 - 2000 : 2500\n\n3 - 10000 : 12500\n\n3.1 - 14000 : 17500\n\n3.2 - 20000 : 25000\n\n4 - 20000 : 25000\n\n4.1 - 50000 : 62500\n\nFrameRate -> (string)\n\nThe frames per second for the video stream in the output file. Valid values include:\n\nauto , 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60\n\nIf you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses the detected frame rate of the input source. If you specify a frame rate, we recommend that you perform the following calculation:\n\nFrame rate = maximum recommended decoding speed in luma samples/second / (width in pixels * height in pixels)\n\nwhere:\n\nwidth in pixels and height in pixels represent the Resolution of the output video.\n\nmaximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second is less than or equal to the maximum value listed in the following table, based on the value that you specified for Level.\n\nThe maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second for each level is described in the following list (Level - Decoding speed ):\n\n1 - 380160\n\n1b - 380160\n\n1.1 - 76800\n\n1.2 - 1536000\n\n1.3 - 3041280\n\n2 - 3041280\n\n2.1 - 5068800\n\n2.2 - 5184000\n\n3 - 10368000\n\n3.1 - 27648000\n\n3.2 - 55296000\n\n4 - 62914560\n\n4.1 - 62914560\n\nMaxFrameRate -> (string)\n\nIf you specify auto for FrameRate , Elastic Transcoder uses the frame rate of the input video for the frame rate of the output video. Specify the maximum frame rate that you want Elastic Transcoder to use when the frame rate of the input video is greater than the desired maximum frame rate of the output video.

You can specify up to four watermarks for each output. Settings for each watermark must be defined in the preset that you specify in Preset for the current output.\n\nWatermarks are added to the output video in the sequence in which you list them in the job output—the first watermark in the list is added to the output video first, the second watermark in the list is added next, and so on. As a result, if the settings in a preset cause Elastic Transcoder to place all watermarks in the same location, the second watermark that you add covers the first one, the third one covers the second, and the fourth one covers the third.\n\n(structure)\n\nWatermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to display a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png format, which supports transparency.\n\nPresetWatermarkId -> (string)\n\nThe ID of the watermark settings that Elastic Transcoder uses to add watermarks to the video during transcoding. The settings are in the preset specified by Preset for the current output. In that preset, the value of Watermarks Id tells Elastic Transcoder which settings to use.\n\nInputKey -> (string)\n\nThe name of the .png or .jpg file that you want to use for the watermark. To determine which Amazon S3 bucket contains the specified file, Elastic Transcoder checks the pipeline specified by Pipeline ; the Input Bucket object in that pipeline identifies the bucket.\n\nIf the file name includes a prefix, for example, logos/128x64.png , include the prefix in the key.

The maximum number of previously decoded frames to use as a reference for decoding future frames. Valid values are integers 0 through 16, but we recommend that you not use a value greater than the following:\n\nMin(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256 / (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)\n\nwhere Width in pixels and Height in pixels represent either MaxWidth and MaxHeight, or Resolution. Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks depends on the value of the Level object. See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of pixels measuring 16x16.)\n\n1 - 396\n\n1b - 396\n\n1.1 - 900\n\n1.2 - 2376\n\n1.3 - 2376\n\n2 - 2376\n\n2.1 - 4752\n\n2.2 - 8100\n\n3 - 8100\n\n3.1 - 18000\n\n3.2 - 20480\n\n4 - 32768\n\n4.1 - 32768\n\nMaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)\n\nThe maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer; the size of the buffer is specified by BufferSize .

This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment duration when you’re using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the container type of the output video. Specify an integer greater than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize , Elastic Transcoder sets BufferSize to 10 times the value of MaxBitRate .\n\nInterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)\n\nThe interlace mode for the output video.\n\nInterlaced video is used to double the perceived frame rate for a video by interlacing two fields (one field on every other line, the other field on the other lines) so that the human eye registers multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing reduces the bandwidth required for transmitting a video, but can result in blurred images and flickering.\n\nValid values include Progressive (no interlacing, top to bottom), TopFirst (top field first), BottomFirst (bottom field first), and Auto .\n\nIf InterlaceMode is not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses Progressive for the output. If Auto is specified, Elastic Transcoder interlaces the output.\n\nColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)\n\nThe color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to the output video. Color spaces are the algorithms used by the computer to store information about how to render color. Bt.601 is the standard for standard definition video, while Bt.709 is the standard for high definition video.\n\nValid values include None , Bt709toBt601 , Bt601toBt709 , and Auto .\n\nIf you chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode and your output is interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 50 , or 60 , your SegmentDuration is null, and you are using one of the resolution changes from the list below, Elastic Transcoder applies the following color space conversions:\n\nStandard to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709\n\nStandard to HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709\n\nHD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601\n\nHD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601\n\nNote\n\nElastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the ColorspaceConversionMode Auto mode in the future. All outputs in a playlist must use the same ColorSpaceConversionMode .\n\nIf you do not specify a ColorSpaceConversionMode , Elastic Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If you are unsure what ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied to your output file, you can check the AppliedColorSpaceConversion parameter included in your job response. If your job does not have an AppliedColorSpaceConversion in its response, no ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied.\n\nChromaSubsampling\n\nThe sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the output video. Valid values include yuv420p and yuv422p .\n\nyuv420p samples the chroma information of every other horizontal and every other vertical line, yuv422p samples the color information of every horizontal line and every other vertical line.\n\nLoopCount (Gif Only)\n\nThe number of times you want the output gif to loop. Valid values include Infinite and integers between 0 and 100 , inclusive.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nKeyframesMaxDist -> (string)\n\nApplicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .\n\nThe maximum number of frames between key frames. Key frames are fully encoded frames; the frames between key frames are encoded based, in part, on the content of the key frames. The value is an integer formatted as a string; valid values are between 1 (every frame is a key frame) and 100000, inclusive. A higher value results in higher compression but may also discernibly decrease video quality.\n\nFor Smooth outputs, the FrameRate must have a constant ratio to the KeyframesMaxDist . This allows Smooth playlists to switch between different quality levels while the file is being played.\n\nFor example, an input file can have a FrameRate of 30 with a KeyframesMaxDist of 90. The output file then needs to have a ratio of 1:3. Valid outputs would have FrameRate of 30, 25, and 10, and KeyframesMaxDist of 90, 75, and 30, respectively.\n\nAlternately, this can be achieved by setting FrameRate to auto and having the same values for MaxFrameRate and KeyframesMaxDist .\n\nFixedGOP -> (string)\n\nApplicable only when the value of Video:Codec is one of H.264 , MPEG2 , or VP8 .\n\nWhether to use a fixed value for FixedGOP . Valid values are true and false :\n\ntrue : Elastic Transcoder uses the value of KeyframesMaxDist for the distance between key frames (the number of frames in a group of pictures, or GOP).\n\nfalse : The distance between key frames can vary.\n\nWarning\n\nFixedGOP must be set to true for fmp4 containers.\n\nBitRate -> (string)\n\nThe bit rate of the video stream in the output file, in kilobits/second. Valid values depend on the values of Level and Profile . If you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses the detected bit rate of the input source. If you specify a value other than auto , we recommend that you specify a value less than or equal to the maximum H.264-compliant value listed for your level and profile:\n\nLevel - Maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (baseline and main Profile) : maximum video bit rate in kilobits/second (high Profile)\n\n1 - 64 : 80\n\n1b - 128 : 160\n\n1.1 - 192 : 240\n\n1.2 - 384 : 480\n\n1.3 - 768 : 960\n\n2 - 2000 : 2500\n\n3 - 10000 : 12500\n\n3.1 - 14000 : 17500\n\n3.2 - 20000 : 25000\n\n4 - 20000 : 25000\n\n4.1 - 50000 : 62500\n\nFrameRate -> (string)\n\nThe frames per second for the video stream in the output file. Valid values include:\n\nauto , 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60\n\nIf you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder uses the detected frame rate of the input source. If you specify a frame rate, we recommend that you perform the following calculation:\n\nFrame rate = maximum recommended decoding speed in luma samples/second / (width in pixels * height in pixels)\n\nwhere:\n\nwidth in pixels and height in pixels represent the Resolution of the output video.\n\nmaximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second is less than or equal to the maximum value listed in the following table, based on the value that you specified for Level.\n\nThe maximum recommended decoding speed in Luma samples/second for each level is described in the following list (Level - Decoding speed ):\n\n1 - 380160\n\n1b - 380160\n\n1.1 - 76800\n\n1.2 - 1536000\n\n1.3 - 3041280\n\n2 - 3041280\n\n2.1 - 5068800\n\n2.2 - 5184000\n\n3 - 10368000\n\n3.1 - 27648000\n\n3.2 - 55296000\n\n4 - 62914560\n\n4.1 - 62914560\n\nMaxFrameRate -> (string)\n\nIf you specify auto for FrameRate , Elastic Transcoder uses the frame rate of the input video for the frame rate of the output video. Specify the maximum frame rate that you want Elastic Transcoder to use when the frame rate of the input video is greater than the desired maximum frame rate of the output video. Valid values include: 10 , 15 , 23.97 , 24 , 25 , 29.97 , 30 , 60 .\n\nResolution -> (string)\n\nWarning\n\nTo better control resolution and aspect ratio of output videos, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth , MaxHeight , SizingPolicy , PaddingPolicy , and DisplayAspectRatio instead of Resolution and AspectRatio . The two groups of settings are mutually exclusive. Do not use them together.\n\nThe width and height of the video in the output file, in pixels. Valid values are auto and width x height :\n\nauto : Elastic Transcoder attempts to preserve the width and height of the input file, subject to the following rules.\n\n``width x height `` : The width and height of the output video in pixels.\n\nNote the following about specifying the width and height:\n\nThe width must be an even integer between 128 and 4096, inclusive.\n\nThe height must be an even integer between 96 and 3072, inclusive.\n\nIf you specify a resolution that is less than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output file to the lower resolution.\n\nIf you specify a resolution that is greater than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output to the higher resolution.\n\nWe recommend that you specify a resolution for which the product of width and height is less than or equal to the applicable value in the following list (List - Max width x height value ):\n\n1 - 25344\n\n1b - 25344\n\n1.1 - 101376\n\n1.2 - 101376\n\n1.3 - 101376\n\n2 - 101376\n\n2.1 - 202752\n\n2.2 - 404720\n\n3 - 404720\n\n3.1 - 921600\n\n3.2 - 1310720\n\n4 - 2097152\n\n4.1 - 2097152\n\nAspectRatio -> (string)\n\nWarning\n\nTo better control resolution and aspect ratio of output videos, we recommend that you use the values MaxWidth , MaxHeight , SizingPolicy , PaddingPolicy , and DisplayAspectRatio instead of Resolution and AspectRatio .

Valid values include:\n\nauto , 1:1 , 4:3 , 3:2 , 16:9\n\nIf you specify auto , Elastic Transcoder tries to preserve the aspect ratio of the video in the output file.\n\nMaxWidth -> (string)\n\nThe maximum width of thumbnails in pixels. If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder uses 1920 (Full HD) as the default value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer between 32 and 4096.\n\nMaxHeight -> (string)\n\nThe maximum height of thumbnails in pixels. If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder uses 1080 (Full HD) as the default value. If you specify a numeric value, enter an even integer between 32 and 3072.\n\nSizingPolicy -> (string)\n\nSpecify one of the following values to control scaling of thumbnails:\n\nFit : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails so they match the value that you specified in thumbnail MaxWidth or MaxHeight settings without exceeding the other value.\n\nFill : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails so they match the value that you specified in thumbnail MaxWidth or MaxHeight settings and matches or exceeds the other value. Elastic Transcoder centers the image in thumbnails and then crops in the dimension (if any) that exceeds the maximum value.\n\nStretch : Elastic Transcoder stretches thumbnails to match the values that you specified for thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight settings. If the relative proportions of the input video and thumbnails are different, the thumbnails will be distorted.\n\nKeep : Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails. If either dimension of the input video exceeds the values that you specified for thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight settings, Elastic Transcoder crops the thumbnails.\n\nShrinkToFit : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails down so that their dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight without exceeding either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails up.\n\nShrinkToFill : Elastic Transcoder scales thumbnails down so that their dimensions match the values that you specified for at least one of MaxWidth and MaxHeight without dropping below either value. If you specify this option, Elastic Transcoder does not scale thumbnails up.\n\nPaddingPolicy -> (string)\n\nWhen you set PaddingPolicy to Pad , Elastic Transcoder may add black bars to the top and bottom and/or left and right sides of thumbnails to make the total size of the thumbnails match the values that you specified for thumbnail MaxWidth and MaxHeight settings.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nWhether the preset is a default preset provided by Elastic Transcoder (System ) or a preset that you have defined (Custom ).",
