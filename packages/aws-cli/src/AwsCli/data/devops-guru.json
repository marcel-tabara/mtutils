You can specify up to 500 AWS CloudFormation stacks.\n\nCloudFormation -> (structure)\n\nAn array of the names of AWS CloudFormation stacks. The stacks define AWS resources that DevOps Guru analyzes.

The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--starting-token (string)\n\nA token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--page-size (integer)\n\nThe size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command’s output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--max-items (integer)\n\nThe total number of items to return in the command’s output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command’s output. To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",
