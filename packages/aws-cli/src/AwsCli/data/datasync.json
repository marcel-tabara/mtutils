This option can affect your storage cost. If your task deletes objects, you might incur minimum storage duration charges for certain storage classes. For detailed information, see Considerations when working with Amazon S3 storage classes in DataSync in the DataSync User Guide .\n\nDefault value: PRESERVE.\n\nPRESERVE: Ignore such destination files (recommended).\n\nREMOVE: Delete destination files that aren’t present in the source.\n\nPreserveDevices -> (string)\n\nA value that determines whether DataSync should preserve the metadata of block and character devices in the source file system, and re-create the files with that device name and metadata on the destination. DataSync does not copy the contents of such devices, only the name and metadata.\n\nNote\n\nDataSync can’t sync the actual contents of such devices, because they are nonterminal and don’t return an end-of-file (EOF) marker.\n\nDefault value: NONE.\n\nNONE: Ignore special devices (recommended).\n\nPRESERVE: Preserve character and block device metadata. This option isn’t currently supported for Amazon EFS.\n\nPosixPermissions -> (string)\n\nA value that determines which users or groups can access a file for a specific purpose such as reading, writing, or execution of the file. This option should only be set for NFS, EFS, and S3 locations. For more information about what metadata is copied by DataSync, see Metadata Copied by DataSync .\n\nDefault value: PRESERVE.\n\nPRESERVE: Preserve POSIX-style permissions (recommended).\n\nNONE: Ignore permissions.\n\nNote\n\nDataSync can preserve extant permissions of a source location.\n\nBytesPerSecond -> (long)\n\nA value that limits the bandwidth used by DataSync. For example, if you want DataSync to use a maximum of 1 MB, set this value to 1048576 (=1024*1024 ).\n\nTaskQueueing -> (string)\n\nA value that determines whether tasks should be queued before executing the tasks. If set to ENABLED , the tasks will be queued. The default is ENABLED .\n\nIf you use the same agent to run multiple tasks, you can enable the tasks to run in series. For more information, see Queueing task executions .\n\nLogLevel -> (string)\n\nA value that determines the type of logs that DataSync publishes to a log stream in the Amazon CloudWatch log group that you provide. For more information about providing a log group for DataSync, see CloudWatchLogGroupArn . If set to OFF , no logs are published. BASIC publishes logs on errors for individual files transferred, and TRANSFER publishes logs for every file or object that is transferred and integrity checked.\n\nTransferMode -> (string)\n\nA value that determines whether DataSync transfers only the data and metadata that differ between the source and the destination location, or whether DataSync transfers all the content from the source, without comparing to the destination location.\n\nCHANGED: DataSync copies only data or metadata that is new or different content from the source location to the destination location.\n\nALL: DataSync copies all source location content to the destination, without comparing to existing content on the destination.\n\nSecurityDescriptorCopyFlags -> (string)\n\nA value that determines which components of the SMB security descriptor are copied from source to destination objects.\n\nThis value is only used for transfers between SMB and Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations, or between two Amazon FSx for Windows File Server locations. For more information about how DataSync handles metadata, see How DataSync Handles Metadata and Special Files .\n\nDefault value: OWNER_DACL.\n\nOWNER_DACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:\n\nObject owner.\n\nNTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object.\n\nWhen choosing this option, DataSync does NOT copy the NTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.\n\nOWNER_DACL_SACL : For each copied object, DataSync copies the following metadata:\n\nObject owner.\n\nNTFS discretionary access control lists (DACLs), which determine whether to grant access to an object.\n\nNTFS system access control lists (SACLs), which are used by administrators to log attempts to access a secured object.\n\nCopying SACLs requires granting additional permissions to the Windows user that DataSync uses to access your SMB location. For information about choosing a user that ensures sufficient permissions to files, folders, and metadata, see user .\n\nNONE : None of the SMB security descriptor components are copied. Destination objects are owned by the user that was provided for accessing the destination location.
