We recommend that the media player retrieve a new manifest on a one-second interval. When this type of session is played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a “live” notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to display.\n\nNote\n\nIn LIVE mode, the newest available fragments are included in an MPEG-DASH manifest, even if there is a gap between fragments (that is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments are not added to the MPEG-DASH manifest if they are older than the newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes available after a subsequent fragment is added to the manifest, the older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.\n\n**LIVE_REPLAY ** : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest is updated similarly to how it is updated for LIVE mode except that it starts by including fragments from a given start time. Instead of fragments being added as they are ingested, fragments are added as the duration of the next fragment elapses. For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long, then a new fragment is added to the manifest every two seconds. This mode is useful to be able to start playback from when an event is detected and continue live streaming media that has not yet been ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode is also useful to stream previously archived media without being limited by the 1,000 fragment limit in the ON_DEMAND mode.\n\n**ON_DEMAND ** : For sessions of this type, the MPEG-DASH manifest contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is specified in MaxManifestFragmentResults . The manifest must be retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to display.\n\nIn all playback modes, if FragmentSelectorType is PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP , and if there are multiple fragments with the same start timestamp, the fragment that has the larger fragment number (that is, the newer fragment) is included in the MPEG-DASH manifest. The other fragments are not included. Fragments that have different timestamps but have overlapping durations are still included in the MPEG-DASH manifest. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media player.\n\nThe default is LIVE .\n\nPossible values:\n\nLIVE\n\nLIVE_REPLAY\n\nON_DEMAND\n\n--display-fragment-timestamp (string)\n\nPer the MPEG-DASH specification, the wall-clock time of fragments in the manifest file can be derived using attributes in the manifest itself. However, typically, MPEG-DASH compatible media players do not properly handle gaps in the media timeline. Kinesis Video Streams adjusts the media timeline in the manifest file to enable playback of media with discontinuities. Therefore, the wall-clock time derived from the manifest file may be inaccurate. If DisplayFragmentTimestamp is set to ALWAYS , the accurate fragment timestamp is added to each S element in the manifest file with the attribute name “kvs:ts”. A custom MPEG-DASH media player is necessary to leverage this custom attribute.\n\nThe default value is NEVER . When DASHFragmentSelector is SERVER_TIMESTAMP , the timestamps will be the server start timestamps. Similarly, when DASHFragmentSelector is PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP , the timestamps will be the producer start timestamps.\n\nPossible values:\n\nALWAYS\n\nNEVER\n\n--display-fragment-number (string)\n\nFragments are identified in the manifest file based on their sequence number in the session. If DisplayFragmentNumber is set to ALWAYS , the Kinesis Video Streams fragment number is added to each S element in the manifest file with the attribute name “kvs:fn”. These fragment numbers can be used for logging or for use with other APIs (e.g. GetMedia and GetMediaForFragmentList ). A custom MPEG-DASH media player is necessary to leverage these this custom attribute.\n\nThe default value is NEVER .\n\nPossible values:\n\nALWAYS\n\nNEVER\n\n--dash-fragment-selector (structure)\n\nThe time range of the requested fragment and the source of the timestamps.\n\nThis parameter is required if PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND or LIVE_REPLAY . This parameter is optional if PlaybackMode is LIVE . If PlaybackMode is LIVE , the FragmentSelectorType can be set, but the TimestampRange should not be set. If PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND or LIVE_REPLAY , both FragmentSelectorType and TimestampRange must be set.\n\nFragmentSelectorType -> (string)\n\nThe source of the timestamps for the requested media.\n\nWhen FragmentSelectorType is set to PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP and GetDASHStreamingSessionURLInput$PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND or LIVE_REPLAY , the first fragment ingested with a producer timestamp within the specified FragmentSelector$TimestampRange is included in the media playlist. In addition, the fragments with producer timestamps within the TimestampRange ingested immediately following the first fragment (up to the GetDASHStreamingSessionURLInput$MaxManifestFragmentResults value) are included.\n\nFragments that have duplicate producer timestamps are deduplicated. This means that if producers are producing a stream of fragments with producer timestamps that are approximately equal to the true clock time, the MPEG-DASH manifest will contain all of the fragments within the requested timestamp range. If some fragments are ingested within the same time range and very different points in time, only the oldest ingested collection of fragments are returned.\n\nWhen FragmentSelectorType is set to PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP and GetDASHStreamingSessionURLInput$PlaybackMode is LIVE , the producer timestamps are used in the MP4 fragments and for deduplication. But the most recently ingested fragments based on server timestamps are included in the MPEG-DASH manifest. This means that even if fragments ingested in the past have producer timestamps with values now, they are not included in the HLS media playlist.\n\nThe default is SERVER_TIMESTAMP .\n\nTimestampRange -> (structure)\n\nThe start and end of the timestamp range for the requested media.\n\nThis value should not be present if PlaybackType is LIVE .\n\nStartTimestamp -> (timestamp)\n\nThe start of the timestamp range for the requested media.\n\nIf the DASHTimestampRange value is specified, the StartTimestamp value is required.\n\nOnly fragments that start exactly at or after StartTimestamp are included in the session. Fragments that start before StartTimestamp and continue past it aren’t included in the session. If FragmentSelectorType is SERVER_TIMESTAMP , the StartTimestamp must be later than the stream head.\n\nEndTimestamp -> (timestamp)\n\nThe end of the timestamp range for the requested media. This value must be within 24 hours of the specified StartTimestamp , and it must be later than the StartTimestamp value.\n\nIf FragmentSelectorType for the request is SERVER_TIMESTAMP , this value must be in the past.\n\nThe EndTimestamp value is required for ON_DEMAND mode, but optional for LIVE_REPLAY mode. If the EndTimestamp is not set for LIVE_REPLAY mode then the session will continue to include newly ingested fragments until the session expires.\n\nNote\n\nThis value is inclusive. The EndTimestamp is compared to the (starting) timestamp of the fragment. Fragments that start before the EndTimestamp value and continue past it are included in the session.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nFragmentSelectorType=string,TimestampRange={StartTimestamp=timestamp,EndTimestamp=timestamp}\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"FragmentSelectorType\": \"PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP\"|\"SERVER_TIMESTAMP\",\n  \"TimestampRange\": {\n    \"StartTimestamp\": timestamp,\n    \"EndTimestamp\": timestamp\n  }\n}\n\n\n--expires (integer)\n\nThe time in seconds until the requested session expires. This value can be between 300 (5 minutes) and 43200 (12 hours).\n\nWhen a session expires, no new calls to GetDashManifest , GetMP4InitFragment , or GetMP4MediaFragment can be made for that session.\n\nThe default is 300 (5 minutes).\n\n--max-manifest-fragment-results (long)\n\nThe maximum number of fragments that are returned in the MPEG-DASH manifest.\n\nWhen the PlaybackMode is LIVE , the most recent fragments are returned up to this value. When the PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND , the oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.\n\nWhen there are a higher number of fragments available in a live MPEG-DASH manifest, video players often buffer content before starting playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency, but it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during playback. We recommend that a live MPEG-DASH manifest have a minimum of 3 fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.\n\nThe default is 5 fragments if PlaybackMode is LIVE or LIVE_REPLAY , and 1,000 if PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND .\n\nThe maximum value of 1,000 fragments corresponds to more than 16 minutes of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 2 1/2 hours of video on streams with 10-second fragments.\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

The HLS media playlist also contains metadata about the stream that the player needs to play it, such as whether the PlaybackMode is LIVE or ON_DEMAND . The HLS media playlist is typically static for sessions with a PlaybackType of ON_DEMAND . The HLS media playlist is continually updated with new fragments for sessions with a PlaybackType of LIVE .

When this type of session is played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a “live” notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to display.\n\nNote\n\nIn LIVE mode, the newest available fragments are included in an HLS media playlist, even if there is a gap between fragments (that is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments are not added to the HLS media playlist if they are older than the newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes available after a subsequent fragment is added to the playlist, the older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.\n\n**LIVE_REPLAY ** : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist is updated similarly to how it is updated for LIVE mode except that it starts by including fragments from a given start time. Instead of fragments being added as they are ingested, fragments are added as the duration of the next fragment elapses. For example, if the fragments in the session are two seconds long, then a new fragment is added to the media playlist every two seconds. This mode is useful to be able to start playback from when an event is detected and continue live streaming media that has not yet been ingested as of the time of the session creation. This mode is also useful to stream previously archived media without being limited by the 1,000 fragment limit in the ON_DEMAND mode.\n\n**ON_DEMAND ** : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is specified in MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults . The playlist must be retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to display.\n\nIn all playback modes, if FragmentSelectorType is PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP , and if there are multiple fragments with the same start timestamp, the fragment that has the largest fragment number (that is, the newest fragment) is included in the HLS media playlist. The other fragments are not included. Fragments that have different timestamps but have overlapping durations are still included in the HLS media playlist. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media player.\n\nThe default is LIVE .\n\nPossible values:\n\nLIVE\n\nLIVE_REPLAY\n\nON_DEMAND\n\n--hls-fragment-selector (structure)\n\nThe time range of the requested fragment and the source of the timestamps.\n\nThis parameter is required if PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND or LIVE_REPLAY . This parameter is optional if PlaybackMode is LIVE . If PlaybackMode is LIVE , the FragmentSelectorType can be set, but the TimestampRange should not be set. If PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND or LIVE_REPLAY , both FragmentSelectorType and TimestampRange must be set.\n\nFragmentSelectorType -> (string)\n\nThe source of the timestamps for the requested media.\n\nWhen FragmentSelectorType is set to PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP and GetHLSStreamingSessionURLInput$PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND or LIVE_REPLAY , the first fragment ingested with a producer timestamp within the specified FragmentSelector$TimestampRange is included in the media playlist. In addition, the fragments with producer timestamps within the TimestampRange ingested immediately following the first fragment (up to the GetHLSStreamingSessionURLInput$MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults value) are included.\n\nFragments that have duplicate producer timestamps are deduplicated. This means that if producers are producing a stream of fragments with producer timestamps that are approximately equal to the true clock time, the HLS media playlists will contain all of the fragments within the requested timestamp range. If some fragments are ingested within the same time range and very different points in time, only the oldest ingested collection of fragments are returned.\n\nWhen FragmentSelectorType is set to PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP and GetHLSStreamingSessionURLInput$PlaybackMode is LIVE , the producer timestamps are used in the MP4 fragments and for deduplication. But the most recently ingested fragments based on server timestamps are included in the HLS media playlist. This means that even if fragments ingested in the past have producer timestamps with values now, they are not included in the HLS media playlist.\n\nThe default is SERVER_TIMESTAMP .\n\nTimestampRange -> (structure)\n\nThe start and end of the timestamp range for the requested media.\n\nThis value should not be present if PlaybackType is LIVE .\n\nStartTimestamp -> (timestamp)\n\nThe start of the timestamp range for the requested media.\n\nIf the HLSTimestampRange value is specified, the StartTimestamp value is required.\n\nOnly fragments that start exactly at or after StartTimestamp are included in the session. Fragments that start before StartTimestamp and continue past it aren’t included in the session. If FragmentSelectorType is SERVER_TIMESTAMP , the StartTimestamp must be later than the stream head.\n\nEndTimestamp -> (timestamp)\n\nThe end of the timestamp range for the requested media. This value must be within 24 hours of the specified StartTimestamp , and it must be later than the StartTimestamp value.\n\nIf FragmentSelectorType for the request is SERVER_TIMESTAMP , this value must be in the past.\n\nThe EndTimestamp value is required for ON_DEMAND mode, but optional for LIVE_REPLAY mode. If the EndTimestamp is not set for LIVE_REPLAY mode then the session will continue to include newly ingested fragments until the session expires.\n\nNote\n\nThis value is inclusive. The EndTimestamp is compared to the (starting) timestamp of the fragment. Fragments that start before the EndTimestamp value and continue past it are included in the session.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nFragmentSelectorType=string,TimestampRange={StartTimestamp=timestamp,EndTimestamp=timestamp}\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"FragmentSelectorType\": \"PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP\"|\"SERVER_TIMESTAMP\",\n  \"TimestampRange\": {\n    \"StartTimestamp\": timestamp,\n    \"EndTimestamp\": timestamp\n  }\n}\n\n\n--container-format (string)\n\nSpecifies which format should be used for packaging the media. Specifying the FRAGMENTED_MP4 container format packages the media into MP4 fragments (fMP4 or CMAF). This is the recommended packaging because there is minimal packaging overhead. The other container format option is MPEG_TS . HLS has supported MPEG TS chunks since it was released and is sometimes the only supported packaging on older HLS players. MPEG TS typically has a 5-25 percent packaging overhead. This means MPEG TS typically requires 5-25 percent more bandwidth and cost than fMP4.\n\nThe default is FRAGMENTED_MP4 .\n\nPossible values:\n\nFRAGMENTED_MP4\n\nMPEG_TS\n\n--discontinuity-mode (string)\n\nSpecifies when flags marking discontinuities between fragments are added to the media playlists.\n\nMedia players typically build a timeline of media content to play, based on the timestamps of each fragment. This means that if there is any overlap or gap between fragments (as is typical if HLSFragmentSelector is set to SERVER_TIMESTAMP ), the media player timeline will also have small gaps between fragments in some places, and will overwrite frames in other places. Gaps in the media player timeline can cause playback to stall and overlaps can cause playback to be jittery. When there are discontinuity flags between fragments, the media player is expected to reset the timeline, resulting in the next fragment being played immediately after the previous fragment.\n\nThe following modes are supported:\n\nALWAYS : a discontinuity marker is placed between every fragment in the HLS media playlist. It is recommended to use a value of ALWAYS if the fragment timestamps are not accurate.\n\nNEVER : no discontinuity markers are placed anywhere. It is recommended to use a value of NEVER to ensure the media player timeline most accurately maps to the producer timestamps.\n\nON_DISCONTINUITY : a discontinuity marker is placed between fragments that have a gap or overlap of more than 50 milliseconds. For most playback scenarios, it is recommended to use a value of ON_DISCONTINUITY so that the media player timeline is only reset when there is a significant issue with the media timeline (e.g. a missing fragment).\n\nThe default is ALWAYS when HLSFragmentSelector is set to SERVER_TIMESTAMP , and NEVER when it is set to PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP .\n\nPossible values:\n\nALWAYS\n\nNEVER\n\nON_DISCONTINUITY\n\n--display-fragment-timestamp (string)\n\nSpecifies when the fragment start timestamps should be included in the HLS media playlist. Typically, media players report the playhead position as a time relative to the start of the first fragment in the playback session. However, when the start timestamps are included in the HLS media playlist, some media players might report the current playhead as an absolute time based on the fragment timestamps. This can be useful for creating a playback experience that shows viewers the wall-clock time of the media.\n\nThe default is NEVER . When HLSFragmentSelector is SERVER_TIMESTAMP , the timestamps will be the server start timestamps. Similarly, when HLSFragmentSelector is PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP , the timestamps will be the producer start timestamps.\n\nPossible values:\n\nALWAYS\n\nNEVER\n\n--expires (integer)\n\nThe time in seconds until the requested session expires. This value can be between 300 (5 minutes) and 43200 (12 hours).\n\nWhen a session expires, no new calls to GetHLSMasterPlaylist , GetHLSMediaPlaylist , GetMP4InitFragment , GetMP4MediaFragment , or GetTSFragment can be made for that session.\n\nThe default is 300 (5 minutes).\n\n--max-media-playlist-fragment-results (long)\n\nThe maximum number of fragments that are returned in the HLS media playlists.\n\nWhen the PlaybackMode is LIVE , the most recent fragments are returned up to this value. When the PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND , the oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number.\n\nWhen there are a higher number of fragments available in a live HLS media playlist, video players often buffer content before starting playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency, but it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during playback. We recommend that a live HLS media playlist have a minimum of 3 fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments.\n\nThe default is 5 fragments if PlaybackMode is LIVE or LIVE_REPLAY , and 1,000 if PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND .\n\nThe maximum value of 5,000 fragments corresponds to more than 80 minutes of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 13 hours of video on streams with 10-second fragments.\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.
