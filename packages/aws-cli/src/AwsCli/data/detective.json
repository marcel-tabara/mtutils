  "service_description": "Description\n\nDetective uses machine learning and purpose-built visualizations to help you analyze and investigate security issues across your Amazon Web Services (AWS) workloads. Detective automatically extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from AWS CloudTrail and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) flow logs. It also extracts findings detected by Amazon GuardDuty.\n\nThe Detective API primarily supports the creation and management of behavior graphs. A behavior graph contains the extracted data from a set of member accounts, and is created and managed by an administrator account.\n\nEvery behavior graph is specific to a Region. You can only use the API to manage graphs that belong to the Region that is associated with the currently selected endpoint.\n\nA Detective administrator account can use the Detective API to do the following:\n\nEnable and disable Detective. Enabling Detective creates a new behavior graph.\n\nView the list of member accounts in a behavior graph.\n\nAdd member accounts to a behavior graph.\n\nRemove member accounts from a behavior graph.\n\nA member account can use the Detective API to do the following:\n\nView the list of behavior graphs that they are invited to.\n\nAccept an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.\n\nDecline an invitation to contribute to a behavior graph.\n\nRemove their account from a behavior graph.\n\nAll API actions are logged as CloudTrail events. See Logging Detective API Calls with CloudTrail .\n\nNote\n\nWe replaced the term “master account” with the term “administrator account.” An administrator account is used to centrally manage multiple accounts. In the case of Detective, the administrator account manages the accounts in their behavior graph."
