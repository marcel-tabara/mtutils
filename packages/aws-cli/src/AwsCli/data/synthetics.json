Canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. You can set up a canary to run continuously or just once.\n\nDo not use CreateCanary to modify an existing canary. Use UpdateCanary instead.\n\nTo create canaries, you must have the CloudWatchSyntheticsFullAccess policy. If you are creating a new IAM role for the canary, you also need the the iam:CreateRole , iam:CreatePolicy and iam:AttachRolePolicy permissions. For more information, see Necessary Roles and Permissions .\n\nDo not include secrets or proprietary information in your canary names. The canary name makes up part of the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the canary, and the ARN is included in outbound calls over the internet.

If you omit this parameter, no changes are made to any baseline screenshots that the canary might be using already.\n\nVisual monitoring is supported only on canaries running the syn-puppeteer-node-3.2 runtime or later. For more information, see Visual monitoring and Visual monitoring blueprint\n\nBaseScreenshots -> (list)\n\nAn array of screenshots that will be used as the baseline for visual monitoring in future runs of this canary.

To obtain the coordinates to use here, use the CloudWatch Logs console to draw the boundaries on the screen. For more information, see {LINK}\n\n(string)\n\nBaseCanaryRunId -> (string)\n\nSpecifies which canary run to use the screenshots from as the baseline for future visual monitoring with this canary. Valid values are nextrun to use the screenshots from the next run after this update is made, lastrun to use the screenshots from the most recent run before this update was made, or the value of Id in the CanaryRun from any past run of this canary.\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"BaseScreenshots\": [\n    {\n      \"ScreenshotName\": \"string\",\n      \"IgnoreCoordinates\": [\"string\", ...]\n    }\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"BaseCanaryRunId\": \"string\"\n}\n\n\n--artifact-s3-location (string)\n\nThe location in Amazon S3 where Synthetics stores artifacts from the test runs of this canary.

You can create and manage canaries , which are modular, lightweight scripts that monitor your endpoints and APIs from the outside-in. You can set up your canaries to run 24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help you check the availability and latency of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data, screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. The canaries seamlessly integrate with CloudWatch ServiceLens to help you trace the causes of impacted nodes in your applications.
