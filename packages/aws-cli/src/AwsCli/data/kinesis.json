Scale-out within a stream is explicitly supported by means of shards, which are uniquely identified groups of data records in a stream.\n\nYou specify and control the number of shards that a stream is composed of. Each shard can support reads up to five transactions per second, up to a maximum data read total of 2 MiB per second. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second. If the amount of data input increases or decreases, you can add or remove shards.\n\nThe stream name identifies the stream. The name is scoped to the AWS account used by the application. It is also scoped by AWS Region. That is, two streams in two different accounts can have the same name, and two streams in the same account, but in two different Regions, can have the same name.\n\nCreateStream is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a CreateStream request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns and sets the stream status to CREATING . After the stream is created, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to ACTIVE . You should perform read and write operations only on an ACTIVE stream.\n\nYou receive a LimitExceededException when making a CreateStream request when you try to do one of the following:\n\nHave more than five streams in the CREATING state at any point in time.\n\nCreate more shards than are authorized for your account.\n\nFor the default shard limit for an AWS account, see Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide .

      "command_description": "Description\n\nGets data records from a Kinesis data stream’s shard.\n\nSpecify a shard iterator using the ShardIterator parameter. The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, GetRecords returns an empty list. It might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records.\n\nYou can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service limits (for more information, see Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide ). Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call GetRecords in a loop. Use GetShardIterator to get the shard iterator to specify in the first GetRecords call. GetRecords returns a new shard iterator in NextShardIterator . Specify the shard iterator returned in NextShardIterator in subsequent calls to GetRecords . If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can’t return more data and GetRecords returns null in NextShardIterator . You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record to process.\n\nEach data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MiB per second. You can ensure that your calls don’t exceed the maximum supported size or throughput by using the Limit parameter to specify the maximum number of records that GetRecords can return. Consider your average record size when determining this limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per call is 10,000.\n\nThe size of the data returned by GetRecords varies depending on the utilization of the shard. The maximum size of data that GetRecords can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw ProvisionedThroughputExceededException . If there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next 1 second throw ProvisionedThroughputExceededException . GetRecords doesn’t return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to GetRecords . However, it’s possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second.\n\nTo detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the MillisBehindLatest response attribute. You can also monitor the stream using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see Monitoring in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide ).\n\nEach Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, ApproximateArrivalTimestamp , that is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream, for example with PutRecords ). The time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of order.\n\nThis operation has a limit of five transactions per second per shard.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

      "command_description": "Description\n\nGets an Amazon Kinesis shard iterator. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester.\n\nA shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. The position is specified using the sequence number of a data record in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record ingested in the stream, and is assigned when a record is put into the stream. Each stream has one or more shards.\n\nYou must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the ShardIteratorType parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number by using the AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER shard iterator type. Alternatively, the parameter can read right after the sequence number by using the AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER shard iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls to PutRecord , PutRecords , GetRecords , or DescribeStream . In the request, you can specify the shard iterator type AT_TIMESTAMP to read records from an arbitrary point in time, TRIM_HORIZON to cause ShardIterator to point to the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system (the oldest data record in the shard), or LATEST so that you always read the most recent data in the shard.\n\nWhen you read repeatedly from a stream, use a GetShardIterator request to get the first shard iterator for use in your first GetRecords request and for subsequent reads use the shard iterator returned by the GetRecords request in NextShardIterator . A new shard iterator is returned by every GetRecords request in NextShardIterator , which you use in the ShardIterator parameter of the next GetRecords request.\n\nIf a GetShardIterator request is made too often, you receive a ProvisionedThroughputExceededException . For more information about throughput limits, see GetRecords , and Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide .\n\nIf the shard is closed, GetShardIterator returns a valid iterator for the last sequence number of the shard. A shard can be closed as a result of using SplitShard or MergeShards .\n\nGetShardIterator has a limit of five transactions per second per account per open shard.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

SplitShard is called when there is a need to increase the overall capacity of a stream because of an expected increase in the volume of data records being ingested.\n\nYou can also use SplitShard when a shard appears to be approaching its maximum utilization; for example, the producers sending data into the specific shard are suddenly sending more than previously anticipated. You can also call SplitShard to increase stream capacity, so that more Kinesis Data Streams applications can simultaneously read data from the stream for real-time processing.\n\nYou must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the position in the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many cases, the new hash key might be the average of the beginning and ending hash key, but it can be any hash key value in the range being mapped into the shard. For more information, see Split a Shard in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide .\n\nYou can use DescribeStream to determine the shard ID and hash key values for the ShardToSplit and NewStartingHashKey parameters that are specified in the SplitShard request.\n\nSplitShard is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a SplitShard request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response and sets the stream status to UPDATING . After the operation is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to ACTIVE . Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the UPDATING state.\n\nYou can use DescribeStream to check the status of the stream, which is returned in StreamStatus . If the stream is in the ACTIVE state, you can call SplitShard . If a stream is in CREATING or UPDATING or DELETING states, DescribeStream returns a ResourceInUseException .\n\nIf the specified stream does not exist, DescribeStream returns a ResourceNotFoundException . If you try to create more shards than are authorized for your account, you receive a LimitExceededException .\n\nFor the default shard limit for an AWS account, see Kinesis Data Streams Limits in the Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide .
