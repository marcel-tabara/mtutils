Instead, use this operation on the parent stack (the stack that contains the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource).\n\n--role-arn (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes to roll back the stack. CloudFormation uses the role’s credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don’t have permission to pass it.

You can’t specify resources that are in the UPDATE_FAILED state for other reasons, for example, because an update was cancelled. To check why a resource update failed, use the DescribeStackResources action, and view the resource status reason.\n\nWarning\n\nSpecify this property to skip rolling back resources that CloudFormation can’t successfully roll back. We recommend that you troubleshoot resources before skipping them. CloudFormation sets the status of the specified resources to UPDATE_COMPLETE and continues to roll back the stack. After the rollback is complete, the state of the skipped resources will be inconsistent with the state of the resources in the stack template. Before performing another stack update, you must update the stack or resources to be consistent with each other. If you don’t, subsequent stack updates might fail, and the stack will become unrecoverable.\n\nSpecify the minimum number of resources required to successfully roll back your stack. For example, a failed resource update might cause dependent resources to fail. In this case, it might not be necessary to skip the dependent resources.\n\nTo skip resources that are part of nested stacks, use the following format: NestedStackName.ResourceLogicalID . If you want to specify the logical ID of a stack resource (Type: AWS::CloudFormation::Stack ) in the ResourcesToSkip list, then its corresponding embedded stack must be in one of the following states: DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , DELETE_COMPLETE , or DELETE_FAILED .\n\nNote\n\nDon’t confuse a child stack’s name with its corresponding logical ID defined in the parent stack.

Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation.\n\nNote\n\nThis capacity does not apply to creating change sets, and specifying it when creating change sets has no effect. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create or update the stack directly from the template using the CreateStack or UpdateStack action, and specifying this capability.\n\nFor more information on macros, see Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates .\n\n(string)\n\nSyntax:\n\n\"string\" \"string\" ...\n\nWhere valid values are:\n  CAPABILITY_IAM\n  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM\n  CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND\n\n\n--resource-types (list)\n\nThe template resource types that you have permissions to work with if you execute this change set, such as AWS::EC2::Instance , AWS::EC2::* , or Custom::MyCustomInstance .\n\nIf the list of resource types doesn’t include a resource type that you’re updating, the stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for condition keys in IAM policies for CloudFormation. For more information, see Controlling Access with Identity and Access Management in the CloudFormation User Guide.\n\n(string)\n\nSyntax:\n\n\"string\" \"string\" ...\n\n\n--role-arn (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes when executing the change set. CloudFormation uses the role’s credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don’t have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.\n\nIf you don’t specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.\n\n--rollback-configuration (structure)\n\nThe rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.\n\nRollbackTriggers -> (list)\n\nThe triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.\n\nBy default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:\n\nTo use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don’t specify this parameter.\n\nTo specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify all the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you’ve specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don’t include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack.\n\nTo remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter.\n\nIf a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back.\n\n(structure)\n\nA rollback trigger CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation.\n\nArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.\n\nIf a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm is the only supported resource type.\n\nMonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)\n\nThe amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.\n\nThe default is 0 minutes.\n\nIf you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using CancelUpdateStack , for example) as necessary.\n\nIf you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nRollbackTriggers=[{Arn=string,Type=string},{Arn=string,Type=string}],MonitoringTimeInMinutes=integer\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"RollbackTriggers\": [\n    {\n      \"Arn\": \"string\",\n      \"Type\": \"string\"\n    }\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"MonitoringTimeInMinutes\": integer\n}\n\n\n--notification-arns (list)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) of Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics that CloudFormation associates with the stack. To remove all associated notification topics, specify an empty list.\n\n(string)\n\nSyntax:\n\n\"string\" \"string\" ...\n\n\n--tags (list)\n\nKey-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum of 50 tags.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nRequired . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) have the reserved prefix: aws: .\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nRequired . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nKey=string,Value=string ...\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Key\": \"string\",\n    \"Value\": \"string\"\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--change-set-name (string)\n\nThe name of the change set. The name must be unique among all change sets that are associated with the specified stack.\n\nA change set name can contain only alphanumeric, case sensitive characters and hyphens. It must start with an alphabetic character and cannot exceed 128 characters.\n\n--client-token (string)\n\nA unique identifier for this CreateChangeSet request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you’re not attempting to create another change set with the same name. You might retry CreateChangeSet requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.\n\n--description (string)\n\nA description to help you identify this change set.\n\n--change-set-type (string)\n\nThe type of change set operation. To create a change set for a new stack, specify CREATE . To create a change set for an existing stack, specify UPDATE . To create a change set for an import operation, specify IMPORT .\n\nIf you create a change set for a new stack, CloudFormation creates a stack with a unique stack ID, but no template or resources. The stack will be in the ` REVIEW_IN_PROGRESS https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-describing-stacks.html#d0e11995`__ state until you execute the change set.\n\nBy default, CloudFormation specifies UPDATE . You can’t use the UPDATE type to create a change set for a new stack or the CREATE type to create a change set for an existing stack.\n\nPossible values:\n\nCREATE\n\nUPDATE\n\nIMPORT\n\n--resources-to-import (list)\n\nThe resources to import into your stack.\n\n(structure)\n\nDescribes the target resource of an import operation.\n\nResourceType -> (string)\n\nThe type of resource to import into your stack, such as AWS::S3::Bucket . For a list of supported resource types, see Resources that support import operations in the CloudFormation User Guide.\n\nLogicalResourceId -> (string)\n\nThe logical ID of the target resource as specified in the template.\n\nResourceIdentifier -> (map)\n\nA key-value pair that identifies the target resource. The key is an identifier property (for example, BucketName for AWS::S3::Bucket resources) and the value is the actual property value (for example, MyS3Bucket ).\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nResourceType=string,LogicalResourceId=string,ResourceIdentifier={KeyName1=string,KeyName2=string} ...\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"ResourceType\": \"string\",\n    \"LogicalResourceId\": \"string\",\n    \"ResourceIdentifier\": {\"string\": \"string\"\n      ...}\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--include-nested-stacks | --no-include-nested-stacks (boolean)\n\nCreates a change set for the all nested stacks specified in the template. The default behavior of this action is set to False . To include nested sets in a change set, specify True .\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.\n\nIf you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.\n\nIf you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM .\n\nIf you don’t specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.\n\nIf your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.\n\nAWS::IAM::AccessKey\n\nAWS::IAM::Group\n\nAWS::IAM::InstanceProfile\n\nAWS::IAM::Policy\n\nAWS::IAM::Role\n\nAWS::IAM::User\n\nAWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition\n\nFor more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in CloudFormation Templates .\n\nCAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability.\n\nWarning\n\nYou should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified.\n\nFor more information, see Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates .\n\n(string)\n\nSyntax:\n\n\"string\" \"string\" ...\n\nWhere valid values are:\n  CAPABILITY_IAM\n  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM\n  CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND\n\n\n--resource-types (list)\n\nThe template resource types that you have permissions to work with for this create stack action, such as AWS::EC2::Instance , AWS::EC2::* , or Custom::MyCustomInstance . Use the following syntax to describe template resource types: AWS::* (for all Amazon Web Services resources), Custom::* (for all custom resources), Custom::*logical_ID* `` (for a specific custom resource), ``AWS::*service_name* ::* (for all resources of a particular Amazon Web Services service), and ``AWS::service_name ::resource_logical_ID `` (for a specific Amazon Web Services resource).\n\nIf the list of resource types doesn’t include a resource that you’re creating, the stack creation fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see Controlling Access with Identity and Access Management .\n\n(string)\n\nSyntax:\n\n\"string\" \"string\" ...\n\n\n--role-arn (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes to create the stack. CloudFormation uses the role’s credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don’t have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.\n\nIf you don’t specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.\n\n--on-failure (string)\n\nDetermines what action will be taken if stack creation fails. This must be one of: DO_NOTHING, ROLLBACK, or DELETE. You can specify either OnFailure or DisableRollback , but not both.\n\nDefault: ROLLBACK\n\nPossible values:\n\nDO_NOTHING\n\nROLLBACK\n\nDELETE\n\n--stack-policy-body (string)\n\nStructure containing the stack policy body. For more information, go to Prevent Updates to Stack Resources in the CloudFormation User Guide . You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.\n\n--stack-policy-url (string)\n\nLocation of a file containing the stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (maximum size: 16 KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.\n\n--tags (list)\n\nKey-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to the resources created in the stack. A maximum number of 50 tags can be specified.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nRequired . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) have the reserved prefix: aws: .\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nRequired . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nKey=string,Value=string ...\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Key\": \"string\",\n    \"Value\": \"string\"\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--client-request-token (string)\n\nA unique identifier for this CreateStack request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you’re not attempting to create a stack with the same name. You might retry CreateStack requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.\n\nAll events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1 , then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1 .\n\nIn the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002 .\n\n--enable-termination-protection | --no-enable-termination-protection (boolean)\n\nWhether to enable termination protection on the specified stack. If a user attempts to delete a stack with termination protection enabled, the operation fails and the stack remains unchanged. For more information, see Protecting a Stack From Being Deleted in the CloudFormation User Guide . Termination protection is disabled on stacks by default.\n\nFor nested stacks , termination protection is set on the root stack and cannot be changed directly on the nested stack.\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values.

Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002 .\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.

For more information, see the Parameter data type.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe Parameter data type.\n\nParameterKey -> (string)\n\nThe key associated with the parameter. If you don’t specify a key and value for a particular parameter, CloudFormation uses the default value that is specified in your template.\n\nParameterValue -> (string)\n\nThe input value associated with the parameter.\n\nUsePreviousValue -> (boolean)\n\nDuring a stack update, use the existing parameter value that the stack is using for a given parameter key. If you specify true , do not specify a parameter value.\n\nResolvedValue -> (string)\n\nRead-only. The value that corresponds to a Systems Manager parameter key. This field is returned only for ` SSM parameter types <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/parameters-section-structure.html#aws-ssm-parameter-types>`__ in the template.\n\nCreationTime -> (timestamp)\n\nThe start time when the change set was created, in UTC.\n\nExecutionStatus -> (string)\n\nIf the change set execution status is AVAILABLE , you can execute the change set. If you can’t execute the change set, the status indicates why. For example, a change set might be in an UNAVAILABLE state because CloudFormation is still creating it or in an OBSOLETE state because the stack was already updated.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nThe current status of the change set, such as CREATE_IN_PROGRESS , CREATE_COMPLETE , or FAILED .\n\nStatusReason -> (string)\n\nA description of the change set’s status. For example, if your attempt to create a change set failed, CloudFormation shows the error message.\n\nNotificationARNs -> (list)\n\nThe ARNs of the Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics that will be associated with the stack if you execute the change set.\n\n(string)\n\nRollbackConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.\n\nRollbackTriggers -> (list)\n\nThe triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.\n\nBy default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:\n\nTo use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don’t specify this parameter.\n\nTo specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify all the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you’ve specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don’t include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack.\n\nTo remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter.\n\nIf a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back.\n\n(structure)\n\nA rollback trigger CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation.\n\nArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.\n\nIf a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm is the only supported resource type.\n\nMonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)\n\nThe amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.\n\nThe default is 0 minutes.\n\nIf you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using CancelUpdateStack , for example) as necessary.\n\nIf you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.\n\nCapabilities -> (list)\n\nIf you execute the change set, the list of capabilities that were explicitly acknowledged when the change set was created.\n\n(string)\n\nTags -> (list)\n\nIf you execute the change set, the tags that will be associated with the stack.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nRequired . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) have the reserved prefix: aws: .\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nRequired . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.\n\nChanges -> (list)\n\nA list of Change structures that describes the resources CloudFormation changes if you execute the change set.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe Change structure describes the changes CloudFormation will perform if you execute the change set.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe type of entity that CloudFormation changes. Currently, the only entity type is Resource .\n\nResourceChange -> (structure)\n\nA ResourceChange structure that describes the resource and action that CloudFormation will perform.\n\nAction -> (string)\n\nThe action that CloudFormation takes on the resource, such as Add (adds a new resource), Modify (changes a resource), Remove (deletes a resource), Import (imports a resource), or Dynamic (exact action for the resource cannot be determined).\n\nLogicalResourceId -> (string)\n\nThe resource’s logical ID, which is defined in the stack’s template.\n\nPhysicalResourceId -> (string)\n\nThe resource’s physical ID (resource name). Resources that you are adding don’t have physical IDs because they haven’t been created.\n\nResourceType -> (string)\n\nThe type of CloudFormation resource, such as AWS::S3::Bucket .\n\nReplacement -> (string)\n\nFor the Modify action, indicates whether CloudFormation will replace the resource by creating a new one and deleting the old one. This value depends on the value of the RequiresRecreation property in the ResourceTargetDefinition structure. For example, if the RequiresRecreation field is Always and the Evaluation field is Static , Replacement is True . If the RequiresRecreation field is Always and the Evaluation field is Dynamic , Replacement is Conditionally .\n\nIf you have multiple changes with different RequiresRecreation values, the Replacement value depends on the change with the most impact. A RequiresRecreation value of Always has the most impact, followed by Conditionally , and then Never .\n\nScope -> (list)\n\nFor the Modify action, indicates which resource attribute is triggering this update, such as a change in the resource attribute’s Metadata , Properties , or Tags .\n\n(string)\n\nDetails -> (list)\n\nFor the Modify action, a list of ResourceChangeDetail structures that describes the changes that CloudFormation will make to the resource.\n\n(structure)\n\nFor a resource with Modify as the action, the ResourceChange structure describes the changes CloudFormation will make to that resource.\n\nTarget -> (structure)\n\nA ResourceTargetDefinition structure that describes the field that CloudFormation will change and whether the resource will be recreated.\n\nAttribute -> (string)\n\nIndicates which resource attribute is triggering this update, such as a change in the resource attribute’s Metadata , Properties , or Tags .\n\nName -> (string)\n\nIf the Attribute value is Properties , the name of the property. For all other attributes, the value is null.\n\nRequiresRecreation -> (string)\n\nIf the Attribute value is Properties , indicates whether a change to this property causes the resource to be recreated. The value can be Never , Always , or Conditionally . To determine the conditions for a Conditionally recreation, see the update behavior for that property in the CloudFormation User Guide.\n\nEvaluation -> (string)\n\nIndicates whether CloudFormation can determine the target value, and whether the target value will change before you execute a change set.\n\nFor Static evaluations, CloudFormation can determine that the target value will change, and its value. For example, if you directly modify the InstanceType property of an EC2 instance, CloudFormation knows that this property value will change, and its value, so this is a Static evaluation.\n\nFor Dynamic evaluations, cannot determine the target value because it depends on the result of an intrinsic function, such as a Ref or Fn::GetAtt intrinsic function, when the stack is updated. For example, if your template includes a reference to a resource that is conditionally recreated, the value of the reference (the physical ID of the resource) might change, depending on if the resource is recreated. If the resource is recreated, it will have a new physical ID, so all references to that resource will also be updated.\n\nChangeSource -> (string)\n\nThe group to which the CausingEntity value belongs. There are five entity groups:\n\nResourceReference entities are Ref intrinsic functions that refer to resources in the template, such as { \"Ref\" : \"MyEC2InstanceResource\" } .\n\nParameterReference entities are Ref intrinsic functions that get template parameter values, such as { \"Ref\" : \"MyPasswordParameter\" } .\n\nResourceAttribute entities are Fn::GetAtt intrinsic functions that get resource attribute values, such as { \"Fn::GetAtt\" : [ \"MyEC2InstanceResource\", \"PublicDnsName\" ] } .\n\nDirectModification entities are changes that are made directly to the template.\n\nAutomatic entities are AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource types, which are also known as nested stacks. If you made no changes to the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource, CloudFormation sets the ChangeSource to Automatic because the nested stack’s template might have changed. Changes to a nested stack’s template aren’t visible to CloudFormation until you run an update on the parent stack.\n\nCausingEntity -> (string)\n\nThe identity of the entity that triggered this change. This entity is a member of the group that is specified by the ChangeSource field. For example, if you modified the value of the KeyPairName parameter, the CausingEntity is the name of the parameter (KeyPairName ).\n\nIf the ChangeSource value is DirectModification , no value is given for CausingEntity .\n\nChangeSetId -> (string)\n\nThe change set ID of the nested change set.\n\nModuleInfo -> (structure)\n\nContains information about the module from which the resource was created, if the resource was created from a module included in the stack template.\n\nTypeHierarchy -> (string)\n\nA concantenated list of the the module type or types containing the resource. Module types are listed starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .\n\nIn the following example, the resource was created from a module of type AWS::First::Example::MODULE , that is nested inside a parent module of type AWS::Second::Example::MODULE .\n\nAWS::First::Example::MODULE/AWS::Second::Example::MODULE\n\nLogicalIdHierarchy -> (string)\n\nA concantenated list of the logical IDs of the module or modules containing the resource. Modules are listed starting with the inner-most nested module, and separated by / .\n\nIn the following example, the resource was created from a module, moduleA , that is nested inside a parent module, moduleB .\n\nmoduleA/moduleB\n\nFor more information, see Referencing resources in a module in the CloudFormation User Guide .\n\nNextToken -> (string)\n\nIf the output exceeds 1 MB, a string that identifies the next page of changes. If there is no additional page, this value is null.\n\nIncludeNestedStacks -> (boolean)\n\nVerifies if IncludeNestedStacks is set to True .\n\nParentChangeSetId -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the change set ID of the parent change set in the current nested change set hierarchy.\n\nRootChangeSetId -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the change set ID of the root change set in the current nested change set hierarchy.",

The command uploads local artifacts, such as source code for an AWS Lambda function or a Swagger file for an AWS API Gateway REST API, to an S3 bucket. The command returns a copy of your template, replacing references to local artifacts with the S3 location where the command uploaded the artifacts.\n\nUse this command to quickly upload local artifacts that might be required by your template. After you package your template’s artifacts, run the deploy command to deploy the returned template.\n\nThis command can upload local artifacts referenced in the following places:\n\nBodyS3Location property for the AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi resource\n\nCode property for the AWS::Lambda::Function resource\n\nCodeUri property for the AWS::Serverless::Function resource\n\nDefinitionS3Location property for the AWS::AppSync::GraphQLSchema resource\n\nRequestMappingTemplateS3Location property for the AWS::AppSync::Resolver resource\n\nResponseMappingTemplateS3Location property for the AWS::AppSync::Resolver resource\n\nDefinitionUri property for the AWS::Serverless::Api resource\n\nLocation parameter for the AWS::Include transform\n\nSourceBundle property for the AWS::ElasticBeanstalk::ApplicationVersion resource\n\nTemplateURL property for the AWS::CloudFormation::Stack resource\n\nCommand.ScriptLocation property for the AWS::Glue::Job resource\n\nDefinitionS3Location property for the AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine resource\n\nTo specify a local artifact in your template, specify a path to a local file or folder, as either an absolute or relative path. The relative path is a location that is relative to your template’s location.\n\nFor example, if your AWS Lambda function source code is in the /home/user/code/lambdafunction/ folder, specify CodeUri: /home/user/code/lambdafunction for the AWS::Serverless::Function resource. The command returns a template and replaces the local path with the S3 location: CodeUri: s3://mybucket/lambdafunction.zip.\n\nIf you specify a file, the command directly uploads it to the S3 bucket. If you specify a folder, the command zips the folder and then uploads the .zip file. For most resources, if you don’t specify a path, the command zips and uploads the current working directory. The exception is AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi; if you don’t specify a BodyS3Location, this command will not upload an artifact to S3.\n\nBefore the command uploads artifacts, it checks if the artifacts are already present in the S3 bucket to prevent unnecessary uploads. The command uses MD5 checksums to compare files. If the values match, the command doesn’t upload the artifacts. Use the --force-upload flag to skip this check and always upload the artifacts.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.\n\nIf you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.\n\nIf you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM .\n\nIf you don’t specify either of these capabilities, CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.\n\nIf your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.\n\nAWS::IAM::AccessKey\n\nAWS::IAM::Group\n\nAWS::IAM::InstanceProfile\n\nAWS::IAM::Policy\n\nAWS::IAM::Role\n\nAWS::IAM::User\n\nAWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition\n\nFor more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in CloudFormation Templates .\n\nCAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by CloudFormation. If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability.\n\nWarning\n\nYou should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without CloudFormation being notified.\n\nFor more information, see Using CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates .\n\n(string)\n\nSyntax:\n\n\"string\" \"string\" ...\n\nWhere valid values are:\n  CAPABILITY_IAM\n  CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM\n  CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND\n\n\n--resource-types (list)\n\nThe template resource types that you have permissions to work with for this update stack action, such as AWS::EC2::Instance , AWS::EC2::* , or Custom::MyCustomInstance .\n\nIf the list of resource types doesn’t include a resource that you’re updating, the stack update fails. By default, CloudFormation grants permissions to all resource types. Identity and Access Management (IAM) uses this parameter for CloudFormation-specific condition keys in IAM policies. For more information, see Controlling Access with Identity and Access Management .\n\n(string)\n\nSyntax:\n\n\"string\" \"string\" ...\n\n\n--role-arn (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that CloudFormation assumes to update the stack. CloudFormation uses the role’s credentials to make calls on your behalf. CloudFormation always uses this role for all future operations on the stack. As long as users have permission to operate on the stack, CloudFormation uses this role even if the users don’t have permission to pass it. Ensure that the role grants least privilege.\n\nIf you don’t specify a value, CloudFormation uses the role that was previously associated with the stack. If no role is available, CloudFormation uses a temporary session that is generated from your user credentials.\n\n--rollback-configuration (structure)\n\nThe rollback triggers for CloudFormation to monitor during stack creation and updating operations, and for the specified monitoring period afterwards.\n\nRollbackTriggers -> (list)\n\nThe triggers to monitor during stack creation or update actions.\n\nBy default, CloudFormation saves the rollback triggers specified for a stack and applies them to any subsequent update operations for the stack, unless you specify otherwise. If you do specify rollback triggers for this parameter, those triggers replace any list of triggers previously specified for the stack. This means:\n\nTo use the rollback triggers previously specified for this stack, if any, don’t specify this parameter.\n\nTo specify new or updated rollback triggers, you must specify all the triggers that you want used for this stack, even triggers you’ve specifed before (for example, when creating the stack or during a previous stack update). Any triggers that you don’t include in the updated list of triggers are no longer applied to the stack.\n\nTo remove all currently specified triggers, specify an empty list for this parameter.\n\nIf a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back.\n\n(structure)\n\nA rollback trigger CloudFormation monitors during creation and updating of stacks. If any of the alarms you specify goes to ALARM state during the stack operation or within the specified monitoring period afterwards, CloudFormation rolls back the entire stack operation.\n\nArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the rollback trigger.\n\nIf a specified trigger is missing, the entire stack operation fails and is rolled back.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe resource type of the rollback trigger. Currently, AWS::CloudWatch::Alarm is the only supported resource type.\n\nMonitoringTimeInMinutes -> (integer)\n\nThe amount of time, in minutes, during which CloudFormation should monitor all the rollback triggers after the stack creation or update operation deploys all necessary resources.\n\nThe default is 0 minutes.\n\nIf you specify a monitoring period but do not specify any rollback triggers, CloudFormation still waits the specified period of time before cleaning up old resources after update operations. You can use this monitoring period to perform any manual stack validation desired, and manually cancel the stack creation or update (using CancelUpdateStack , for example) as necessary.\n\nIf you specify 0 for this parameter, CloudFormation still monitors the specified rollback triggers during stack creation and update operations. Then, for update operations, it begins disposing of old resources immediately once the operation completes.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nRollbackTriggers=[{Arn=string,Type=string},{Arn=string,Type=string}],MonitoringTimeInMinutes=integer\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"RollbackTriggers\": [\n    {\n      \"Arn\": \"string\",\n      \"Type\": \"string\"\n    }\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"MonitoringTimeInMinutes\": integer\n}\n\n\n--stack-policy-body (string)\n\nStructure containing a new stack policy body. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.\n\nYou might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack is unchanged.\n\n--stack-policy-url (string)\n\nLocation of a file containing the updated stack policy. The URL must point to a policy (max size: 16KB) located in an S3 bucket in the same Region as the stack. You can specify either the StackPolicyBody or the StackPolicyURL parameter, but not both.\n\nYou might update the stack policy, for example, in order to protect a new resource that you created during a stack update. If you do not specify a stack policy, the current policy that is associated with the stack is unchanged.\n\n--notification-arns (list)\n\nAmazon Simple Notification Service topic Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) that CloudFormation associates with the stack. Specify an empty list to remove all notification topics.\n\n(string)\n\nSyntax:\n\n\"string\" \"string\" ...\n\n\n--tags (list)\n\nKey-value pairs to associate with this stack. CloudFormation also propagates these tags to supported resources in the stack. You can specify a maximum number of 50 tags.\n\nIf you don’t specify this parameter, CloudFormation doesn’t modify the stack’s tags. If you specify an empty value, CloudFormation removes all associated tags.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe Tag type enables you to specify a key-value pair that can be used to store information about an CloudFormation stack.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nRequired . A string used to identify this tag. You can specify a maximum of 128 characters for a tag key. Tags owned by Amazon Web Services (Amazon Web Services) have the reserved prefix: aws: .\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nRequired . A string containing the value for this tag. You can specify a maximum of 256 characters for a tag value.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nKey=string,Value=string ...\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Key\": \"string\",\n    \"Value\": \"string\"\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--disable-rollback | --no-disable-rollback (boolean)\n\nPreserve the state of previously provisioned resources when an operation fails.\n\nDefault: False\n\n--client-request-token (string)\n\nA unique identifier for this UpdateStack request. Specify this token if you plan to retry requests so that CloudFormation knows that you’re not attempting to update a stack with the same name. You might retry UpdateStack requests to ensure that CloudFormation successfully received them.\n\nAll events triggered by a given stack operation are assigned the same client request token, which you can use to track operations. For example, if you execute a CreateStack operation with the token token1 , then all the StackEvents generated by that operation will have ClientRequestToken set as token1 .\n\nIn the console, stack operations display the client request token on the Events tab. Stack operations that are initiated from the console use the token format Console-StackOperation-ID , which helps you easily identify the stack operation . For example, if you create a stack using the console, each stack event would be assigned the same token in the following format: Console-CreateStack-7f59c3cf-00d2-40c7-b2ff-e75db0987002 .\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.

  "service_description": "Description\n\nCloudFormation allows you to create and manage Amazon Web Services infrastructure deployments predictably and repeatedly. You can use CloudFormation to leverage Amazon Web Services products, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, Amazon Elastic Block Store, Amazon Simple Notification Service, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling to build highly-reliable, highly scalable, cost-effective applications without creating or configuring the underlying Amazon Web Services infrastructure.\n\nWith CloudFormation, you declare all of your resources and dependencies in a template file. The template defines a collection of resources as a single unit called a stack. CloudFormation creates and deletes all member resources of the stack together and manages all dependencies between the resources for you.\n\nFor more information about CloudFormation, see the CloudFormation Product Page .\n\nCloudFormation makes use of other Amazon Web Services products. If you need additional technical information about a specific Amazon Web Services product, you can find the product’s technical documentation at ` docs.aws.amazon.com https://docs.aws.amazon.com/`__ ."
