Do not store personal data in this field.\n\n--resource-attribute-list (list)\n\nInformation about the resource that is being migrated. This data will be used to map the task to a resource in the Application Discovery Service repository.\n\nNote\n\nTakes the object array of ResourceAttribute where the Type field is reserved for the following values: IPV4_ADDRESS | IPV6_ADDRESS | MAC_ADDRESS | FQDN | VM_MANAGER_ID | VM_MANAGED_OBJECT_REFERENCE | VM_NAME | VM_PATH | BIOS_ID | MOTHERBOARD_SERIAL_NUMBER where the identifying value can be a string up to 256 characters.\n\nWarning\n\nIf any “VM” related value is set for a ResourceAttribute object, it is required that VM_MANAGER_ID , as a minimum, is always set. If VM_MANAGER_ID is not set, then all “VM” fields will be discarded and “VM” fields will not be used for matching the migration task to a server in Application Discovery Service repository. See the Example section below for a use case of specifying “VM” related values.\n\nIf a server you are trying to match has multiple IP or MAC addresses, you should provide as many as you know in separate type/value pairs passed to the ResourceAttributeList parameter to maximize the chances of matching.\n\n(structure)\n\nAttribute associated with a resource.\n\nNote the corresponding format required per type listed below:\n\nIPV4\n\nx.x.x.x\n\nwhere x is an integer in the range [0,255]\n\nIPV6\n\ny : y : y : y : y : y : y : y\n\nwhere y is a hexadecimal between 0 and FFFF.

Used to test if the caller has permission to make the call.\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

Also, you must make the API calls while in your home region."
