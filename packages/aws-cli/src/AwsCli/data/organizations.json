The user who calls the API for an invitation to join must have the organizations:AcceptHandshake permission. If you enabled all features in the organization, the user must also have the iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permission so that AWS Organizations can create the required service-linked role named AWSServiceRoleForOrganizations . For more information, see AWS Organizations and Service-Linked Roles in the AWS Organizations User Guide .\n\nEnable all features final confirmation handshake: only a principal from the management account. For more information about invitations, see Inviting an AWS Account to Join Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide. For more information about requests to enable all features in the organization, see Enabling All Features in Your Organization in the AWS Organizations User Guide.\n\nAfter you accept a handshake, it continues to appear in the results of relevant APIs for only 30 days.

Use the ActionType element to limit the output to only a specified type, such as INVITE , ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES , or APPROVE-ALL-FEATURES . Alternatively, for the ENABLE-ALL-FEATURES handshake that generates a separate child handshake for each member account, you can specify the ParentHandshakeId to see only the handshakes that were generated by that parent request.\n\nActionType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the type of handshake action.\n\nIf you specify ActionType , you cannot also specify ParentHandshakeId .\n\nParentHandshakeId -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the parent handshake. Only used for handshake types that are a child of another type.\n\nIf you specify ParentHandshakeId , you cannot also specify ActionType .\n\nThe regex pattern for handshake ID string requires “h-” followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nActionType=string,ParentHandshakeId=string\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"ActionType\": \"INVITE\"|\"ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES\"|\"APPROVE_ALL_FEATURES\"|\"ADD_ORGANIZATIONS_SERVICE_LINKED_ROLE\",\n  \"ParentHandshakeId\": \"string\"\n}\n\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--starting-token (string)\n\nA token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--page-size (integer)\n\nThe size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command’s output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--max-items (integer)\n\nThe total number of items to return in the command’s output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command’s output. To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

For example, when a management account (the originator) invites another account (the recipient) to join its organization, the two accounts exchange information as a series of handshake requests and responses.\n\nNote: Handshakes that are CANCELED , ACCEPTED , or DECLINED show up in lists for only 30 days after entering that state After that they are deleted.\n\nId -> (string)\n\nThe unique identifier (ID) of a handshake. The originating account creates the ID when it initiates the handshake.\n\nThe regex pattern for handshake ID string requires “h-” followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.\n\nArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a handshake.\n\nFor more information about ARNs in Organizations, see ARN Formats Supported by Organizations in the AWS Service Authorization Reference .\n\nParties -> (list)\n\nInformation about the two accounts that are participating in the handshake.\n\n(structure)\n\nIdentifies a participant in a handshake.\n\nId -> (string)\n\nThe unique identifier (ID) for the party.\n\nThe regex pattern for handshake ID string requires “h-” followed by from 8 to 32 lowercase letters or digits.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe type of party.\n\nState -> (string)\n\nThe current state of the handshake. Use the state to trace the flow of the handshake through the process from its creation to its acceptance. The meaning of each of the valid values is as follows:\n\nREQUESTED : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some handshake types) and not all recipients have responded yet. The request stays in this state until all recipients respond.\n\nOPEN : This handshake was sent to multiple recipients (applicable to only some policy types) and all recipients have responded, allowing the originator to complete the handshake action.\n\nCANCELED : This handshake is no longer active because it was canceled by the originating account.\n\nACCEPTED : This handshake is complete because it has been accepted by the recipient.\n\nDECLINED : This handshake is no longer active because it was declined by the recipient account.\n\nEXPIRED : This handshake is no longer active because the originator did not receive a response of any kind from the recipient before the expiration time (15 days).\n\nRequestedTimestamp -> (timestamp)\n\nThe date and time that the handshake request was made.\n\nExpirationTimestamp -> (timestamp)\n\nThe date and time that the handshake expires. If the recipient of the handshake request fails to respond before the specified date and time, the handshake becomes inactive and is no longer valid.\n\nAction -> (string)\n\nThe type of handshake, indicating what action occurs when the recipient accepts the handshake. The following handshake types are supported:\n\nINVITE : This type of handshake represents a request to join an organization. It is always sent from the management account to only non-member accounts.\n\nENABLE_ALL_FEATURES : This type of handshake represents a request to enable all features in an organization. It is always sent from the management account to only invited member accounts. Created accounts do not receive this because those accounts were created by the organization’s management account and approval is inferred.\n\nAPPROVE_ALL_FEATURES : This type of handshake is sent from the Organizations service when all member accounts have approved the ENABLE_ALL_FEATURES invitation. It is sent only to the management account and signals the master that it can finalize the process to enable all features.\n\nResources -> (list)\n\nAdditional information that is needed to process the handshake.\n\n(structure)\n\nContains additional data that is needed to process a handshake.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe information that is passed to the other party in the handshake. The format of the value string must match the requirements of the specified type.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe type of information being passed, specifying how the value is to be interpreted by the other party:\n\nACCOUNT - Specifies an AWS account ID number.\n\nORGANIZATION - Specifies an organization ID number.\n\nEMAIL - Specifies the email address that is associated with the account that receives the handshake.\n\nOWNER_EMAIL - Specifies the email address associated with the management account. Included as information about an organization.\n\nOWNER_NAME - Specifies the name associated with the management account. Included as information about an organization.\n\nNOTES - Additional text provided by the handshake initiator and intended for the recipient to read.\n\nResources -> (list)\n\nWhen needed, contains an additional array of HandshakeResource objects.\n\n(structure)\n\nContains additional data that is needed to process a handshake.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe information that is passed to the other party in the handshake. The format of the value string must match the requirements of the specified type.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe type of information being passed, specifying how the value is to be interpreted by the other party:\n\nACCOUNT - Specifies an AWS account ID number.\n\nORGANIZATION - Specifies an organization ID number.\n\nEMAIL - Specifies the email address that is associated with the account that receives the handshake.\n\nOWNER_EMAIL - Specifies the email address associated with the management account. Included as information about an organization.\n\nOWNER_NAME - Specifies the name associated with the management account. Included as information about an organization.\n\nNOTES - Additional text provided by the handshake initiator and intended for the recipient to read.\n\nNextToken -> (string)\n\nIf present, indicates that more output is available than is included in the current response.

It’s no longer subject to any policies and is responsible for its own bill payments. The organization’s management account is no longer charged for any expenses accrued by the member account after it’s removed from the organization.\n\nThis operation can be called only from the organization’s management account. Member accounts can remove themselves with LeaveOrganization instead.\n\nWarning\n\nYou can remove an account from your organization only if the account is configured with the information required to operate as a standalone account. When you create an account in an organization using the AWS Organizations console, API, or CLI commands, the information required of standalone accounts is not automatically collected. For an account that you want to make standalone, you must choose a support plan, provide and verify the required contact information, and provide a current payment method. AWS uses the payment method to charge for any billable (not free tier) AWS activity that occurs while the account isn’t attached to an organization. To remove an account that doesn’t yet have this information, you must sign in as the member account and follow the steps at To leave an organization when all required account information has not yet been provided in the AWS Organizations User Guide.\n\nThe account that you want to leave must not be a delegated administrator account for any AWS service enabled for your organization. If the account is a delegated administrator, you must first change the delegated administrator account to another account that is remaining in the organization.\n\nAfter the account leaves the organization, all tags that were attached to the account object in the organization are deleted. AWS accounts outside of an organization do not support tags.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",
