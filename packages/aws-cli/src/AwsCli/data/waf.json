For more information, see FieldToMatch .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts of a request that you can search include the following:\n\nHEADER : A specified request header, for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header. If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\n\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\n\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\n\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\n\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet .\n\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\n\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\nData -> (string)\n\nWhen the value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is not case sensitive.\n\nWhen the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter name is not case sensitive.\n\nIf the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .\n\nTargetString -> (blob)\n\nThe value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches for the specified string in the part of web requests that you specified in FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.\n\nValid values depend on the values that you specified for FieldToMatch :\n\nHEADER : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that you specified in FieldToMatch , for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header.\n\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the request. CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\n\nQUERY_STRING : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character.\n\nURI : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\n\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet .\n\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\n\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but instead of inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\nIf TargetString includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.\n\nIf you’re using the AWS WAF API\n\nSpecify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.\n\nFor example, suppose the value of Type is HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent . If you want to search the User-Agent header for the value BadBot , you base64-encode BadBot using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, QmFkQm90 , in the value of TargetString .\n\nIf you’re using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs\n\nThe value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.\n\nTextTransformation -> (string)\n\nText transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on FieldToMatch before inspecting it for a match.\n\nYou can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.\n\nCMD_LINE\n\nWhen you’re concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:\n\nDelete the following characters: ” ‘ ^\n\nDelete spaces before the following characters: / (\n\nReplace the following characters with a space: , ;\n\nReplace multiple spaces with one space\n\nConvert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\n\nUse this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):\n\nf, formfeed, decimal 12\n\nt, tab, decimal 9\n\nn, newline, decimal 10\n\nr, carriage return, decimal 13\n\nv, vertical tab, decimal 11\n\nnon-breaking space, decimal 160\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.\n\nHTML_ENTITY_DECODE\n\nUse this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:\n\nReplaces (ampersand)quot; with \"\n\nReplaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160\n\nReplaces (ampersand)lt; with a “less than” symbol\n\nReplaces (ampersand)gt; with >\n\nReplaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the corresponding characters\n\nReplaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the corresponding characters\n\nLOWERCASE\n\nUse this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).\n\nURL_DECODE\n\nUse this option to decode a URL-encoded value.\n\nNONE\n\nSpecify NONE if you don’t want to perform any text transformations.\n\nPositionalConstraint -> (string)\n\nWithin the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the following:\n\nCONTAINS\n\nThe specified part of the web request must include the value of TargetString , but the location doesn’t matter.\n\nCONTAINS_WORD\n\nThe specified part of the web request must include the value of TargetString , and TargetString must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, TargetString must be a word, which means one of the following:\n\nTargetString exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request, such as the value of a header.\n\nTargetString is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, BadBot; .\n\nTargetString is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, ;BadBot .\n\nTargetString is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore (_), for example, -BadBot; .\n\nEXACTLY\n\nThe value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of TargetString .\n\nSTARTS_WITH\n\nThe value of TargetString must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request.\n\nENDS_WITH\n\nThe value of TargetString must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request.\n\nChangeToken -> (string)\n\nThe ChangeToken that you used to submit the CreateByteMatchSet request. You can also use this value to query the status of the request. For more information, see GetChangeTokenStatus ."

For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nCreates a RateBasedRule . The RateBasedRule contains a RateLimit , which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The RateBasedRule also contains the IPSet objects, ByteMatchSet objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the RateLimit .\n\nIf you add more than one predicate to a RateBasedRule , a request not only must exceed the RateLimit , but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked. For example, suppose you add the following to a RateBasedRule :\n\nAn IPSet that matches the IP address 192.0.2.44/32\n\nA ByteMatchSet that matches BadBot in the User-Agent header\n\nFurther, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000.\n\nYou then add the RateBasedRule to a WebACL and specify that you want to block requests that meet the conditions in the rule. For a request to be blocked, it must come from the IP address 192.0.2.44 and the User-Agent header in the request must contain the value BadBot . Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes. If both conditions are met and the rate is exceeded, AWS WAF blocks the requests. If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests.\n\nAs a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site. To do this, you could add the following to a RateBasedRule :\n\nA ByteMatchSet with FieldToMatch of URI\n\nA PositionalConstraint of STARTS_WITH\n\nA TargetString of login\n\nFurther, you specify a RateLimit of 1,000.\n\nBy adding this RateBasedRule to a WebACL , you could limit requests to your login page without affecting the rest of your site.\n\nTo create and configure a RateBasedRule , perform the following steps:\n\nCreate and update the predicates that you want to include in the rule.

If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\n\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\n\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\n\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\n\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

      "command_output": "Output\n\nWebACL -> (structure)\n\nThe WebACL returned in the CreateWebACL response.\n\nWebACLId -> (string)\n\nA unique identifier for a WebACL . You use WebACLId to get information about a WebACL (see GetWebACL ), update a WebACL (see UpdateWebACL ), and delete a WebACL from AWS WAF (see DeleteWebACL ).\n\nWebACLId is returned by CreateWebACL and by ListWebACLs .\n\nName -> (string)\n\nA friendly name or description of the WebACL . You can’t change the name of a WebACL after you create it.\n\nMetricName -> (string)\n\nA friendly name or description for the metrics for this WebACL . The name can contain only alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9), with maximum length 128 and minimum length one. It can’t contain whitespace or metric names reserved for AWS WAF, including “All” and “Default_Action.” You can’t change MetricName after you create the WebACL .\n\nDefaultAction -> (structure)\n\nThe action to perform if none of the Rules contained in the WebACL match. The action is specified by the WafAction object.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:\n\nALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests\n\nBLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests\n\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can’t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\nRules -> (list)\n\nAn array that contains the action for each Rule in a WebACL , the priority of the Rule , and the ID of the Rule .\n\n(structure)\n\nNote\n\nThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation. For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nThe ActivatedRule object in an UpdateWebACL request specifies a Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the Rule in the WebACL , and the action that you want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the Rule (ALLOW , BLOCK , or COUNT ).\n\nTo specify whether to insert or delete a Rule , use the Action parameter in the WebACLUpdate data type.\n\nPriority -> (integer)\n\nSpecifies the order in which the Rules in a WebACL are evaluated. Rules with a lower value for Priority are evaluated before Rules with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to a WebACL , the values don’t need to be consecutive.\n\nRuleId -> (string)\n\nThe RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more information about a Rule (see GetRule ), update a Rule (see UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one from a WebACL (see UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF (see DeleteRule ).\n\nRuleId is returned by CreateRule and by ListRules .\n\nAction -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the conditions in the Rule . Valid values for Action include the following:\n\nALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.\n\nBLOCK : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.\n\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case, you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:\n\nALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests\n\nBLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests\n\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can’t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\nOverrideAction -> (structure)\n\nUse the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .\n\nAny rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request. If you set the OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup will block a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the request and is configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction to Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using GetSampledRequests .\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nCOUNT overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the rule’s action will take place.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe rule type, either REGULAR , as defined by Rule , RATE_BASED , as defined by RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as defined by RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the type, the UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.\n\nExcludedRules -> (list)\n\nAn array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup .\n\nSometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.\n\nSpecifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to COUNT . Therefore, requests that match an ExcludedRule are counted but not blocked. The RuleGroup owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .\n\nIf you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:\n\nUse the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more information about the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .\n\nSubmit an UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:\n\nThe first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the UpdateWebACL request, the first Updates:Action should be DELETE and Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that contains the rules that you want to exclude.\n\nThe second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second Updates:Action should be INSERT , Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that you just removed, and ExcludedRules should contain the rules that you want to exclude.\n\n(structure)\n\nNote\n\nThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation.

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nThe rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup . The rule must belong to the RuleGroup that is specified by the ActivatedRule .\n\nRuleId -> (string)\n\nThe unique identifier for the rule to exclude from the rule group.\n\nWebACLArn -> (string)\n\nTha Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the web ACL.\n\nChangeToken -> (string)\n\nThe ChangeToken that you used to submit the CreateWebACL request.

For more information, see FieldToMatch .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts of a request that you can search include the following:\n\nHEADER : A specified request header, for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header. If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\n\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\n\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\n\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\n\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet .\n\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\n\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\nData -> (string)\n\nWhen the value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, User-Agent or Referer . The name of the header is not case sensitive.\n\nWhen the value of Type is SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , enter the name of the parameter that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, UserName or SalesRegion . The parameter name is not case sensitive.\n\nIf the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .\n\nTargetString -> (blob)\n\nThe value that you want AWS WAF to search for. AWS WAF searches for the specified string in the part of web requests that you specified in FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.\n\nValid values depend on the values that you specified for FieldToMatch :\n\nHEADER : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that you specified in FieldToMatch , for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header.\n\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the request. CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\n\nQUERY_STRING : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character.\n\nURI : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\n\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet .\n\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\n\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but instead of inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\nIf TargetString includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.\n\nIf you’re using the AWS WAF API\n\nSpecify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.\n\nFor example, suppose the value of Type is HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent . If you want to search the User-Agent header for the value BadBot , you base64-encode BadBot using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, QmFkQm90 , in the value of TargetString .\n\nIf you’re using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs\n\nThe value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.\n\nTextTransformation -> (string)\n\nText transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on FieldToMatch before inspecting it for a match.\n\nYou can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.\n\nCMD_LINE\n\nWhen you’re concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:\n\nDelete the following characters: ” ‘ ^\n\nDelete spaces before the following characters: / (\n\nReplace the following characters with a space: , ;\n\nReplace multiple spaces with one space\n\nConvert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\n\nUse this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):\n\nf, formfeed, decimal 12\n\nt, tab, decimal 9\n\nn, newline, decimal 10\n\nr, carriage return, decimal 13\n\nv, vertical tab, decimal 11\n\nnon-breaking space, decimal 160\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.\n\nHTML_ENTITY_DECODE\n\nUse this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:\n\nReplaces (ampersand)quot; with \"\n\nReplaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160\n\nReplaces (ampersand)lt; with a “less than” symbol\n\nReplaces (ampersand)gt; with >\n\nReplaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the corresponding characters\n\nReplaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the corresponding characters\n\nLOWERCASE\n\nUse this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).\n\nURL_DECODE\n\nUse this option to decode a URL-encoded value.\n\nNONE\n\nSpecify NONE if you don’t want to perform any text transformations.\n\nPositionalConstraint -> (string)\n\nWithin the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the following:\n\nCONTAINS\n\nThe specified part of the web request must include the value of TargetString , but the location doesn’t matter.\n\nCONTAINS_WORD\n\nThe specified part of the web request must include the value of TargetString , and TargetString must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, TargetString must be a word, which means one of the following:\n\nTargetString exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request, such as the value of a header.\n\nTargetString is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, BadBot; .\n\nTargetString is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, ;BadBot .\n\nTargetString is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore (_), for example, -BadBot; .\n\nEXACTLY\n\nThe value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of TargetString .\n\nSTARTS_WITH\n\nThe value of TargetString must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request.\n\nENDS_WITH\n\nThe value of TargetString must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request."

AWS WAF uses this in combination with the provided Size and FieldToMatch to build an expression in the form of “Size ComparisonOperator size in bytes of FieldToMatch “. If that expression is true, the SizeConstraint is considered to match.\n\nEQ : Used to test if the Size is equal to the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nNE : Used to test if the Size is not equal to the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nLE : Used to test if the Size is less than or equal to the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nLT : Used to test if the Size is strictly less than the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nGE : Used to test if the Size is greater than or equal to the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nGT : Used to test if the Size is strictly greater than the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nSize -> (long)\n\nThe size in bytes that you want AWS WAF to compare against the size of the specified FieldToMatch . AWS WAF uses this in combination with ComparisonOperator and FieldToMatch to build an expression in the form of “Size ComparisonOperator size in bytes of FieldToMatch “. If that expression is true, the SizeConstraint is considered to match.\n\nValid values for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20 GB).\n\nIf you specify URI for the value of Type , the / in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI /logo.jpg is nine characters long."

Rules with a lower value for Priority are evaluated before Rules with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to a WebACL , the values don’t need to be consecutive.\n\nRuleId -> (string)\n\nThe RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more information about a Rule (see GetRule ), update a Rule (see UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one from a WebACL (see UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF (see DeleteRule ).\n\nRuleId is returned by CreateRule and by ListRules .\n\nAction -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the conditions in the Rule .

You can’t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\nOverrideAction -> (structure)\n\nUse the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .\n\nAny rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request. If you set the OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup will block a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the request and is configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction to Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using GetSampledRequests .\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nCOUNT overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the rule’s action will take place.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe rule type, either REGULAR , as defined by Rule , RATE_BASED , as defined by RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as defined by RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the type, the UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.\n\nExcludedRules -> (list)\n\nAn array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup .\n\nSometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.\n\nSpecifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to COUNT . Therefore, requests that match an ExcludedRule are counted but not blocked. The RuleGroup owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .\n\nIf you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:\n\nUse the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more information about the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .\n\nSubmit an UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:\n\nThe first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the UpdateWebACL request, the first Updates:Action should be DELETE and Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that contains the rules that you want to exclude.\n\nThe second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second Updates:Action should be INSERT , Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that you just removed, and ExcludedRules should contain the rules that you want to exclude.\n\n(structure)\n\nNote\n\nThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation.

HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:\n\nReplaces (ampersand)quot; with \"\n\nReplaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160\n\nReplaces (ampersand)lt; with a “less than” symbol\n\nReplaces (ampersand)gt; with >\n\nReplaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the corresponding characters\n\nReplaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the corresponding characters\n\nLOWERCASE\n\nUse this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).\n\nURL_DECODE\n\nUse this option to decode a URL-encoded value.\n\nNONE\n\nSpecify NONE if you don’t want to perform any text transformations."

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nThe ActivatedRule object in an UpdateWebACL request specifies a Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the Rule in the WebACL , and the action that you want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the Rule (ALLOW , BLOCK , or COUNT ).\n\nTo specify whether to insert or delete a Rule , use the Action parameter in the WebACLUpdate data type.\n\nPriority -> (integer)\n\nSpecifies the order in which the Rules in a WebACL are evaluated. Rules with a lower value for Priority are evaluated before Rules with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to a WebACL , the values don’t need to be consecutive.\n\nRuleId -> (string)\n\nThe RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more information about a Rule (see GetRule ), update a Rule (see UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one from a WebACL (see UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF (see DeleteRule ).\n\nRuleId is returned by CreateRule and by ListRules .\n\nAction -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the conditions in the Rule . Valid values for Action include the following:\n\nALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.\n\nBLOCK : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.\n\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case, you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:\n\nALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests\n\nBLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests\n\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can’t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\nOverrideAction -> (structure)\n\nUse the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .\n\nAny rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request. If you set the OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup will block a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the request and is configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction to Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using GetSampledRequests .\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nCOUNT overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the rule’s action will take place.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe rule type, either REGULAR , as defined by Rule , RATE_BASED , as defined by RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as defined by RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the type, the UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.\n\nExcludedRules -> (list)\n\nAn array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup .\n\nSometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.\n\nSpecifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to COUNT . Therefore, requests that match an ExcludedRule are counted but not blocked. The RuleGroup owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .\n\nIf you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:\n\nUse the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more information about the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .\n\nSubmit an UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:\n\nThe first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the UpdateWebACL request, the first Updates:Action should be DELETE and Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that contains the rules that you want to exclude.\n\nThe second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second Updates:Action should be INSERT , Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that you just removed, and ExcludedRules should contain the rules that you want to exclude.\n\n(structure)\n\nNote\n\nThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation.

If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\n\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\n\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\n\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\n\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet .\n\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .

AWS WAF searches for the specified string in the part of web requests that you specified in FieldToMatch . The maximum length of the value is 50 bytes.\n\nValid values depend on the values that you specified for FieldToMatch :\n\nHEADER : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the request header that you specified in FieldToMatch , for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header.\n\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicates the type of operation specified in the request. CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\n\nQUERY_STRING : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character.\n\nURI : The value that you want AWS WAF to search for in the part of a URL that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\n\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.

The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\n\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but instead of inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF inspects all parameters within the query string for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\nIf TargetString includes alphabetic characters A-Z and a-z, note that the value is case sensitive.\n\nIf you’re using the AWS WAF API\n\nSpecify a base64-encoded version of the value. The maximum length of the value before you base64-encode it is 50 bytes.\n\nFor example, suppose the value of Type is HEADER and the value of Data is User-Agent . If you want to search the User-Agent header for the value BadBot , you base64-encode BadBot using MIME base64-encoding and include the resulting value, QmFkQm90 , in the value of TargetString .\n\nIf you’re using the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs\n\nThe value that you want AWS WAF to search for. The SDK automatically base64 encodes the value.\n\nTextTransformation -> (string)\n\nText transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on FieldToMatch before inspecting it for a match.\n\nYou can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.\n\nCMD_LINE\n\nWhen you’re concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:\n\nDelete the following characters: ” ‘ ^\n\nDelete spaces before the following characters: / (\n\nReplace the following characters with a space: , ;\n\nReplace multiple spaces with one space\n\nConvert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\n\nUse this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):\n\nf, formfeed, decimal 12\n\nt, tab, decimal 9\n\nn, newline, decimal 10\n\nr, carriage return, decimal 13\n\nv, vertical tab, decimal 11\n\nnon-breaking space, decimal 160\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.\n\nHTML_ENTITY_DECODE\n\nUse this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters. HTML_ENTITY_DECODE performs the following operations:\n\nReplaces (ampersand)quot; with \"\n\nReplaces (ampersand)nbsp; with a non-breaking space, decimal 160\n\nReplaces (ampersand)lt; with a “less than” symbol\n\nReplaces (ampersand)gt; with >\n\nReplaces characters that are represented in hexadecimal format, (ampersand)#xhhhh; , with the corresponding characters\n\nReplaces characters that are represented in decimal format, (ampersand)#nnnn; , with the corresponding characters\n\nLOWERCASE\n\nUse this option to convert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z).\n\nURL_DECODE\n\nUse this option to decode a URL-encoded value.\n\nNONE\n\nSpecify NONE if you don’t want to perform any text transformations.\n\nPositionalConstraint -> (string)\n\nWithin the portion of a web request that you want to search (for example, in the query string, if any), specify where you want AWS WAF to search. Valid values include the following:\n\nCONTAINS\n\nThe specified part of the web request must include the value of TargetString , but the location doesn’t matter.\n\nCONTAINS_WORD\n\nThe specified part of the web request must include the value of TargetString , and TargetString must contain only alphanumeric characters or underscore (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or _). In addition, TargetString must be a word, which means one of the following:\n\nTargetString exactly matches the value of the specified part of the web request, such as the value of a header.\n\nTargetString is at the beginning of the specified part of the web request and is followed by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, BadBot; .\n\nTargetString is at the end of the specified part of the web request and is preceded by a character other than an alphanumeric character or underscore (_), for example, ;BadBot .\n\nTargetString is in the middle of the specified part of the web request and is preceded and followed by characters other than alphanumeric characters or underscore (_), for example, -BadBot; .\n\nEXACTLY\n\nThe value of the specified part of the web request must exactly match the value of TargetString .\n\nSTARTS_WITH\n\nThe value of TargetString must appear at the beginning of the specified part of the web request.\n\nENDS_WITH\n\nThe value of TargetString must appear at the end of the specified part of the web request.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nAction=string,ByteMatchTuple={FieldToMatch={Type=string,Data=string},TargetString=blob,TextTransformation=string,PositionalConstraint=string} ...\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Action\": \"INSERT\"|\"DELETE\",\n    \"ByteMatchTuple\": {\n      \"FieldToMatch\": {\n        \"Type\": \"URI\"|\"QUERY_STRING\"|\"HEADER\"|\"METHOD\"|\"BODY\"|\"SINGLE_QUERY_ARG\"|\"ALL_QUERY_ARGS\",\n        \"Data\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"TargetString\": blob,\n      \"TextTransformation\": \"NONE\"|\"COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\"|\"HTML_ENTITY_DECODE\"|\"LOWERCASE\"|\"CMD_LINE\"|\"URL_DECODE\",\n      \"PositionalConstraint\": \"EXACTLY\"|\"STARTS_WITH\"|\"ENDS_WITH\"|\"CONTAINS\"|\"CONTAINS_WORD\"\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.

If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\n\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\n\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\n\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\n\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet .\n\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion .

Use DELETE to remove an ActivatedRule from a RuleGroup .\n\nActivatedRule -> (structure)\n\nThe ActivatedRule object specifies a Rule that you want to insert or delete, the priority of the Rule in the WebACL , and the action that you want AWS WAF to take when a web request matches the Rule (ALLOW , BLOCK , or COUNT ).\n\nPriority -> (integer)\n\nSpecifies the order in which the Rules in a WebACL are evaluated. Rules with a lower value for Priority are evaluated before Rules with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to a WebACL , the values don’t need to be consecutive.\n\nRuleId -> (string)\n\nThe RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more information about a Rule (see GetRule ), update a Rule (see UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one from a WebACL (see UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF (see DeleteRule ).\n\nRuleId is returned by CreateRule and by ListRules .\n\nAction -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the conditions in the Rule . Valid values for Action include the following:\n\nALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.\n\nBLOCK : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.\n\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case, you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:\n\nALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests\n\nBLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests\n\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can’t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\nOverrideAction -> (structure)\n\nUse the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .\n\nAny rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request. If you set the OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup will block a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the request and is configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction to Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using GetSampledRequests .\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nCOUNT overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the rule’s action will take place.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe rule type, either REGULAR , as defined by Rule , RATE_BASED , as defined by RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as defined by RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the type, the UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.\n\nExcludedRules -> (list)\n\nAn array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup .\n\nSometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.\n\nSpecifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to COUNT . Therefore, requests that match an ExcludedRule are counted but not blocked. The RuleGroup owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .\n\nIf you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:\n\nUse the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more information about the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .\n\nSubmit an UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:\n\nThe first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the UpdateWebACL request, the first Updates:Action should be DELETE and Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that contains the rules that you want to exclude.\n\nThe second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second Updates:Action should be INSERT , Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that you just removed, and ExcludedRules should contain the rules that you want to exclude.\n\n(structure)\n\nNote\n\nThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation.

With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nThe rule to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup . The rule must belong to the RuleGroup that is specified by the ActivatedRule .\n\nRuleId -> (string)\n\nThe unique identifier for the rule to exclude from the rule group.\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Action\": \"INSERT\"|\"DELETE\",\n    \"ActivatedRule\": {\n      \"Priority\": integer,\n      \"RuleId\": \"string\",\n      \"Action\": {\n        \"Type\": \"BLOCK\"|\"ALLOW\"|\"COUNT\"\n      },\n      \"OverrideAction\": {\n        \"Type\": \"NONE\"|\"COUNT\"\n      },\n      \"Type\": \"REGULAR\"|\"RATE_BASED\"|\"GROUP\",\n      \"ExcludedRules\": [\n        {\n          \"RuleId\": \"string\"\n        }\n        ...\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--change-token (string)\n\nThe value returned by the most recent call to GetChangeToken .\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

Use DELETE to remove a SizeConstraintSetUpdate from a SizeConstraintSet .\n\nSizeConstraint -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies a constraint on the size of a part of the web request. AWS WAF uses the Size , ComparisonOperator , and FieldToMatch to build an expression in the form of “Size ComparisonOperator size in bytes of FieldToMatch “. If that expression is true, the SizeConstraint is considered to match.\n\nFieldToMatch -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies where in a web request to look for the size constraint.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe part of the web request that you want AWS WAF to search for a specified string. Parts of a request that you can search include the following:\n\nHEADER : A specified request header, for example, the value of the User-Agent or Referer header. If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\n\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\n\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\n\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\n\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form. The request body immediately follows the request headers. Note that only the first 8192 bytes of the request body are forwarded to AWS WAF for inspection. To allow or block requests based on the length of the body, you can create a size constraint set. For more information, see CreateSizeConstraintSet .\n\nSINGLE_QUERY_ARG : The parameter in the query string that you will inspect, such as UserName or SalesRegion . The maximum length for SINGLE_QUERY_ARG is 30 characters.\n\nALL_QUERY_ARGS : Similar to SINGLE_QUERY_ARG , but rather than inspecting a single parameter, AWS WAF will inspect all parameters within the query for the value or regex pattern that you specify in TargetString .\n\nData -> (string)\n\nWhen the value of Type is HEADER , enter the name of the header that you want AWS WAF to search, for example, User-Agent or Referer .

The parameter name is not case sensitive.\n\nIf the value of Type is any other value, omit Data .\n\nTextTransformation -> (string)\n\nText transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass AWS WAF. If you specify a transformation, AWS WAF performs the transformation on FieldToMatch before inspecting it for a match.\n\nYou can only specify a single type of TextTransformation.\n\nNote that if you choose BODY for the value of Type , you must choose NONE for TextTransformation because CloudFront forwards only the first 8192 bytes for inspection.\n\nNONE\n\nSpecify NONE if you don’t want to perform any text transformations.\n\nCMD_LINE\n\nWhen you’re concerned that attackers are injecting an operating system command line command and using unusual formatting to disguise some or all of the command, use this option to perform the following transformations:\n\nDelete the following characters: ” ‘ ^\n\nDelete spaces before the following characters: / (\n\nReplace the following characters with a space: , ;\n\nReplace multiple spaces with one space\n\nConvert uppercase letters (A-Z) to lowercase (a-z)\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\n\nUse this option to replace the following characters with a space character (decimal 32):\n\nf, formfeed, decimal 12\n\nt, tab, decimal 9\n\nn, newline, decimal 10\n\nr, carriage return, decimal 13\n\nv, vertical tab, decimal 11\n\nnon-breaking space, decimal 160\n\nCOMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE also replaces multiple spaces with one space.\n\nHTML_ENTITY_DECODE\n\nUse this option to replace HTML-encoded characters with unencoded characters.

AWS WAF uses this in combination with the provided Size and FieldToMatch to build an expression in the form of “Size ComparisonOperator size in bytes of FieldToMatch “. If that expression is true, the SizeConstraint is considered to match.\n\nEQ : Used to test if the Size is equal to the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nNE : Used to test if the Size is not equal to the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nLE : Used to test if the Size is less than or equal to the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nLT : Used to test if the Size is strictly less than the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nGE : Used to test if the Size is greater than or equal to the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nGT : Used to test if the Size is strictly greater than the size of the FieldToMatch\n\nSize -> (long)\n\nThe size in bytes that you want AWS WAF to compare against the size of the specified FieldToMatch . AWS WAF uses this in combination with ComparisonOperator and FieldToMatch to build an expression in the form of “Size ComparisonOperator size in bytes of FieldToMatch “. If that expression is true, the SizeConstraint is considered to match.\n\nValid values for size are 0 - 21474836480 bytes (0 - 20 GB).\n\nIf you specify URI for the value of Type , the / in the URI counts as one character. For example, the URI /logo.jpg is nine characters long.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nAction=string,SizeConstraint={FieldToMatch={Type=string,Data=string},TextTransformation=string,ComparisonOperator=string,Size=long} ...\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"Action\": \"INSERT\"|\"DELETE\",\n    \"SizeConstraint\": {\n      \"FieldToMatch\": {\n        \"Type\": \"URI\"|\"QUERY_STRING\"|\"HEADER\"|\"METHOD\"|\"BODY\"|\"SINGLE_QUERY_ARG\"|\"ALL_QUERY_ARGS\",\n        \"Data\": \"string\"\n      },\n      \"TextTransformation\": \"NONE\"|\"COMPRESS_WHITE_SPACE\"|\"HTML_ENTITY_DECODE\"|\"LOWERCASE\"|\"CMD_LINE\"|\"URL_DECODE\",\n      \"ComparisonOperator\": \"EQ\"|\"NE\"|\"LE\"|\"LT\"|\"GE\"|\"GT\",\n      \"Size\": long\n    }\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.

For more information, see AWS WAF Classic in the developer guide.\n\nFor the latest version of AWS WAF , use the AWS WAFV2 API and see the AWS WAF Developer Guide . With the latest version, AWS WAF has a single set of endpoints for regional and global use.\n\nInserts or deletes ActivatedRule objects in a WebACL . Each Rule identifies web requests that you want to allow, block, or count. When you update a WebACL , you specify the following values:\n\nA default action for the WebACL , either ALLOW or BLOCK . AWS WAF performs the default action if a request doesn’t match the criteria in any of the Rules in a WebACL .\n\nThe Rules that you want to add or delete. If you want to replace one Rule with another, you delete the existing Rule and add the new one.\n\nFor each Rule , whether you want AWS WAF to allow requests, block requests, or count requests that match the conditions in the Rule .\n\nThe order in which you want AWS WAF to evaluate the Rules in a WebACL . If you add more than one Rule to a WebACL , AWS WAF evaluates each request against the Rules in order based on the value of Priority . (The Rule that has the lowest value for Priority is evaluated first.) When a web request matches all the predicates (such as ByteMatchSets and IPSets ) in a Rule , AWS WAF immediately takes the corresponding action, allow or block, and doesn’t evaluate the request against the remaining Rules in the WebACL , if any.\n\nTo create and configure a WebACL , perform the following steps:\n\nCreate and update the predicates that you want to include in Rules . For more information, see CreateByteMatchSet , UpdateByteMatchSet , CreateIPSet , UpdateIPSet , CreateSqlInjectionMatchSet , and UpdateSqlInjectionMatchSet .\n\nCreate and update the Rules that you want to include in the WebACL . For more information, see CreateRule and UpdateRule .\n\nCreate a WebACL . See CreateWebACL .\n\nUse GetChangeToken to get the change token that you provide in the ChangeToken parameter of an UpdateWebACL request.\n\nSubmit an UpdateWebACL request to specify the Rules that you want to include in the WebACL , to specify the default action, and to associate the WebACL with a CloudFront distribution. The ActivatedRule can be a rule group. If you specify a rule group as your ActivatedRule , you can exclude specific rules from that rule group. If you already have a rule group associated with a web ACL and want to submit an UpdateWebACL request to exclude certain rules from that rule group, you must first remove the rule group from the web ACL, the re-insert it again, specifying the excluded rules. For details, see ActivatedRule$ExcludedRules .\n\nBe aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the rule type when first creating the rule, the UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule (the default rule type) with the specified ID, which does not exist.\n\nFor more information about how to use the AWS WAF API to allow or block HTTP requests, see the AWS WAF Developer Guide .\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

Rules with a lower value for Priority are evaluated before Rules with a higher value. The value must be a unique integer. If you add multiple Rules to a WebACL , the values don’t need to be consecutive.\n\nRuleId -> (string)\n\nThe RuleId for a Rule . You use RuleId to get more information about a Rule (see GetRule ), update a Rule (see UpdateRule ), insert a Rule into a WebACL or delete a one from a WebACL (see UpdateWebACL ), or delete a Rule from AWS WAF (see DeleteRule ).\n\nRuleId is returned by CreateRule and by ListRules .\n\nAction -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies the action that CloudFront or AWS WAF takes when a web request matches the conditions in the Rule . Valid values for Action include the following:\n\nALLOW : CloudFront responds with the requested object.\n\nBLOCK : CloudFront responds with an HTTP 403 (Forbidden) status code.\n\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of requests that match the conditions in the rule and then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL.\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case, you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies how you want AWS WAF to respond to requests that match the settings in a Rule . Valid settings include the following:\n\nALLOW : AWS WAF allows requests\n\nBLOCK : AWS WAF blocks requests\n\nCOUNT : AWS WAF increments a counter of the requests that match all of the conditions in the rule. AWS WAF then continues to inspect the web request based on the remaining rules in the web ACL. You can’t specify COUNT for the default action for a WebACL .\n\nOverrideAction -> (structure)\n\nUse the OverrideAction to test your RuleGroup .\n\nAny rule in a RuleGroup can potentially block a request. If you set the OverrideAction to None , the RuleGroup will block a request if any individual rule in the RuleGroup matches the request and is configured to block that request. However if you first want to test the RuleGroup , set the OverrideAction to Count . The RuleGroup will then override any block action specified by individual rules contained within the group. Instead of blocking matching requests, those requests will be counted. You can view a record of counted requests using GetSampledRequests .\n\nActivatedRule|OverrideAction applies only when updating or adding a RuleGroup to a WebACL . In this case you do not use ActivatedRule|Action . For all other update requests, ActivatedRule|Action is used instead of ActivatedRule|OverrideAction .\n\nType -> (string)\n\nCOUNT overrides the action specified by the individual rule within a RuleGroup . If set to NONE , the rule’s action will take place.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe rule type, either REGULAR , as defined by Rule , RATE_BASED , as defined by RateBasedRule , or GROUP , as defined by RuleGroup . The default is REGULAR. Although this field is optional, be aware that if you try to add a RATE_BASED rule to a web ACL without setting the type, the UpdateWebACL request will fail because the request tries to add a REGULAR rule with the specified ID, which does not exist.\n\nExcludedRules -> (list)\n\nAn array of rules to exclude from a rule group. This is applicable only when the ActivatedRule refers to a RuleGroup .\n\nSometimes it is necessary to troubleshoot rule groups that are blocking traffic unexpectedly (false positives). One troubleshooting technique is to identify the specific rule within the rule group that is blocking the legitimate traffic and then disable (exclude) that particular rule. You can exclude rules from both your own rule groups and AWS Marketplace rule groups that have been associated with a web ACL.\n\nSpecifying ExcludedRules does not remove those rules from the rule group. Rather, it changes the action for the rules to COUNT . Therefore, requests that match an ExcludedRule are counted but not blocked. The RuleGroup owner will receive COUNT metrics for each ExcludedRule .\n\nIf you want to exclude rules from a rule group that is already associated with a web ACL, perform the following steps:\n\nUse the AWS WAF logs to identify the IDs of the rules that you want to exclude. For more information about the logs, see Logging Web ACL Traffic Information .\n\nSubmit an UpdateWebACL request that has two actions:\n\nThe first action deletes the existing rule group from the web ACL. That is, in the UpdateWebACL request, the first Updates:Action should be DELETE and Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that contains the rules that you want to exclude.\n\nThe second action inserts the same rule group back in, but specifying the rules to exclude. That is, the second Updates:Action should be INSERT , Updates:ActivatedRule:RuleId should be the rule group that you just removed, and ExcludedRules should contain the rules that you want to exclude.\n\n(structure)\n\nNote\n\nThis is AWS WAF Classic documentation.

If you choose HEADER for the type, specify the name of the header in Data .\n\nMETHOD : The HTTP method, which indicated the type of operation that the request is asking the origin to perform. Amazon CloudFront supports the following methods: DELETE , GET , HEAD , OPTIONS , PATCH , POST , and PUT .\n\nQUERY_STRING : A query string, which is the part of a URL that appears after a ? character, if any.\n\nURI : The part of a web request that identifies a resource, for example, /images/daily-ad.jpg .\n\nBODY : The part of a request that contains any additional data that you want to send to your web server as the HTTP request body, such as data from a form.
