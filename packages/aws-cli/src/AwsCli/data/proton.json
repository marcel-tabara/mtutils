  "service_description": "Description\n\nThis is the AWS Proton Service API Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for the AWS Proton service.\n\nThe documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the AWS CLI to access an API. For more information, see the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\nThe AWS Proton service is a two-pronged automation framework. Administrators create service templates to provide standardized infrastructure and deployment tooling for serverless and container based applications. Developers, in turn, select from the available service templates to automate their application or service deployments.\n\nBecause administrators define the infrastructure and tooling that AWS Proton deploys and manages, they need permissions to use all of the listed API operations.\n\nWhen developers select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, AWS Proton deploys their applications. To monitor their applications that are running on AWS Proton, developers need permissions to the service create , list , update and delete API operations and the service instance list and update API operations.\n\nTo learn more about AWS Proton administration, see the AWS Proton Administrator Guide .\n\nTo learn more about deploying serverless and containerized applications on AWS Proton, see the AWS Proton User Guide .\n\nEnsuring Idempotency\n\nWhen you make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete. Operations might also time out or encounter other server issues before they’re complete, even if the request already returned a result. This might make it difficult to determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation completes successfully. However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the operation occurs multiple times. This means that you might create more resources than you intended.\n\nIdempotency ensures that an API request action completes no more than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain updated information, such as the current creation status.\n\nThe following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure idempotency.\n\nIdempotent create APIs with a client token\n\nThe API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a client token . The corresponding AWS CLI commands also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the request. We recommend that you don’t reuse the same client token for other API requests. If you don’t provide a client token for these APIs, a default client token is automatically provided by SDKs.\n\nGiven a request action that has succeeded:\n\nIf you retry the request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.\n\nIf you retry the request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are different, the retry throws a ValidationException with an IdempotentParameterMismatch error.\n\nClient tokens expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with the expired token, a new resource is created.\n\nIf the original resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is created.\n\nIdempotent create APIs with a client token:\n\nCreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion\n\nCreateServiceTemplateVersion\n\nCreateEnvironmentAccountConnection\n\nIdempotent create APIs\n\nGiven a request action that has succeeded:\n\nIf you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original resource hasn’t been modified, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response.\n\nIf the original resource has been modified, the retry throws a ConflictException .\n\nIf you retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a ValidationException with an IdempotentParameterMismatch error.\n\nIdempotent create APIs:\n\nCreateEnvironmentTemplate\n\nCreateServiceTemplate\n\nCreateEnvironment\n\nCreateService\n\nIdempotent delete APIs\n\nGiven a request action that has succeeded:\n\nWhen you retry the request with an API from this group and the resource was deleted, its metadata is returned in the response.\n\nIf you retry and the resource doesn’t exist, the response is empty.\n\nIn both cases, the retry succeeds.\n\nIdempotent delete APIs:\n\nDeleteEnvironmentTemplate\n\nDeleteEnvironmentTemplateVersion\n\nDeleteServiceTemplate\n\nDeleteServiceTemplateVersion\n\nDeleteEnvironmentAccountConnection\n\nAsynchronous idempotent delete APIs\n\nGiven a request action that has succeeded:\n\nIf you retry the request with an API from this group, if the original request delete operation status is DELETE_IN_PROGRESS , the retry returns the resource detail data in the response without performing any further actions.\n\nIf the original request delete operation is complete, a retry returns an empty response.\n\nAsynchronous idempotent delete APIs:\n\nDeleteEnvironment\n\nDeleteService"
