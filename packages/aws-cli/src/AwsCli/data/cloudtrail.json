For example, the EC2 GetConsoleOutput is a read-only API operation and RunInstances is a write-only API operation.\n\nBy default, the value is All .\n\nIncludeManagementEvents -> (boolean)\n\nSpecify if you want your event selector to include management events for your trail.\n\nFor more information, see Management Events in the CloudTrail User Guide .\n\nBy default, the value is true .\n\nThe first copy of management events is free. You are charged for additional copies of management events that you are logging on any subsequent trail in the same region. For more information about CloudTrail pricing, see CloudTrail Pricing .\n\nDataResources -> (list)\n\nCloudTrail supports data event logging for Amazon S3 objects, Lambda functions, and Amazon DynamoDB tables with basic event selectors. You can specify up to 250 resources for an individual event selector, but the total number of data resources cannot exceed 250 across all event selectors in a trail. This limit does not apply if you configure resource logging for all data events.\n\nFor more information, see Data Events and Limits in CloudTrail in the CloudTrail User Guide .\n\n(structure)\n\nThe Amazon S3 buckets, Lambda functions, or Amazon DynamoDB tables that you specify in your event selectors for your trail to log data events. Data events provide information about the resource operations performed on or within a resource itself. These are also known as data plane operations. You can specify up to 250 data resources for a trail.\n\nNote\n\nThe total number of allowed data resources is 250. This number can be distributed between 1 and 5 event selectors, but the total cannot exceed 250 across all selectors.\n\nIf you are using advanced event selectors, the maximum total number of values for all conditions, across all advanced event selectors for the trail, is 500.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named bucket-1 . In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and the option to log both Read and Write data events.\n\nA user uploads an image file to bucket-1 .\n\nThe PutObject API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur on any object in that bucket are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.\n\nA user uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2 .\n\nThe PutObject API operation occurred for an object in an S3 bucket that the CloudTrail user didn’t specify for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of Lambda data events for a Lambda function named MyLambdaFunction , but not for all Lambda functions.\n\nA user runs a script that includes a call to the MyLambdaFunction function and the MyOtherLambdaFunction function.\n\nThe Invoke API operation on MyLambdaFunction is an Lambda API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified logging data events for MyLambdaFunction , any invocations of that function are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.\n\nThe Invoke API operation on MyOtherLambdaFunction is an Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data events for all Lambda functions, the Invoke operation for MyOtherLambdaFunction does not match the function specified for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe resource type in which you want to log data events. You can specify AWS::S3::Object , AWS::Lambda::Function , or AWS::DynamoDB::Table resources.\n\nThe AWS::S3Outposts::Object , AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node , AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint , and AWS::EC2::Snapshot resource types are not valid in basic event selectors. To log data events on these resource types, use advanced event selectors.\n\nValues -> (list)\n\nAn array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or partial ARN strings for the specified objects.\n\nTo log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets in your Amazon Web Services account, specify the prefix as arn:aws:s3::: .\n\nNote\n\nThis also enables logging of data event activity performed by any user or role in your Amazon Web Services account, even if that activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another Amazon Web Services account.\n\nTo log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket, specify the bucket and an empty object prefix such as arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/ . The trail logs data events for all objects in this S3 bucket.\n\nTo log data events for specific objects, specify the S3 bucket and object prefix such as arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images . The trail logs data events for objects in this S3 bucket that match the prefix.\n\nTo log data events for all Lambda functions in your Amazon Web Services account, specify the prefix as arn:aws:lambda .\n\nNote\n\nThis also enables logging of Invoke activity performed by any user or role in your Amazon Web Services account, even if that activity is performed on a function that belongs to another Amazon Web Services account.\n\nTo log data events for a specific Lambda function, specify the function ARN.\n\nNote\n\nLambda function ARNs are exact. For example, if you specify a function ARN arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld , data events will only be logged for arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld . They will not be logged for arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld2 .\n\nTo log data events for all DynamoDB tables in your Amazon Web Services account, specify the prefix as arn:aws:dynamodb .\n\n(string)\n\nExcludeManagementEventSources -> (list)\n\nAn optional list of service event sources from which you do not want management events to be logged on your trail. In this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or it can filter out Key Management Service or Amazon RDS Data API events by containing kms.amazonaws.com or rdsdata.amazonaws.com . By default, ExcludeManagementEventSources is empty, and KMS and Amazon RDS Data API events are logged to your trail.\n\n(string)\n\nAdvancedEventSelectors -> (list)\n\nThe advanced event selectors that are configured for the trail.\n\n(structure)\n\nAdvanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for the following CloudTrail event record ﬁelds. They help you control costs by logging only those events that are important to you. For more information about advanced event selectors, see Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .\n\nreadOnly\n\neventSource\n\neventName\n\neventCategory\n\nresources.type\n\nresources.ARN\n\nYou cannot apply both event selectors and advanced event selectors to a trail.\n\nName -> (string)\n\nAn optional, descriptive name for an advanced event selector, such as “Log data events for only two S3 buckets”.\n\nFieldSelectors -> (list)\n\nContains all selector statements in an advanced event selector.\n\n(structure)\n\nA single selector statement in an advanced event selector.\n\nField -> (string)\n\nA field in an event record on which to filter events to be logged. Supported fields include readOnly , eventCategory , eventSource (for management events), eventName , resources.type , and resources.ARN .\n\n**readOnly ** - Optional. Can be set to Equals a value of true or false . A value of false logs both read and write events.\n\n**eventSource ** - For filtering management events only. This can be set only to NotEquals kms.amazonaws.com .\n\n**eventName ** - Can use any operator. You can use it to ﬁlter in or ﬁlter out any data event logged to CloudTrail, such as PutBucket or GetSnapshotBlock . You can have multiple values for this ﬁeld, separated by commas.\n\n**eventCategory ** - This is required. It must be set to Equals , and the value must be Management or Data .\n\n**resources.type ** - This ﬁeld is required. resources.type can only use the Equals operator, and the value can be one of the following: AWS::S3::Object , AWS::S3::AccessPoint , AWS::Lambda::Function , AWS::DynamoDB::Table , AWS::S3Outposts::Object , AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node , AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint , or AWS::EC2::Snapshot . You can have only one resources.type ﬁeld per selector. To log data events on more than one resource type, add another selector.\n\n**resources.ARN ** - You can use any operator with resources.ARN, but if you use Equals or NotEquals , the value must exactly match the ARN of a valid resource of the type you’ve speciﬁed in the template as the value of resources.type. For example, if resources.type equals AWS::S3::Object , the ARN must be in one of the following formats. To log all data events for all objects in a specific S3 bucket, use the StartsWith operator, and include only the bucket ARN as the matching value. The trailing slash is intentional; do not exclude it. Replace the text between less than and greater than symbols (<>) with resource-specific information.\n\narn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/\n\narn:<partition>:s3:::<bucket_name>/<object_path>/\n\nWhen resources.type equals AWS::S3::AccessPoint , and the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals , the ARN must be in one of the following formats. To log events on all objects in an S3 access point, we recommend that you use only the access point ARN, don’t include the object path, and use the StartsWith or NotStartsWith operators.\n\narn:<partition>:s3:<region>:<account_ID>:accesspoint/<access_point_name>\n\narn:<partition>:s3:<region>:<account_ID>:accesspoint/<access_point_name>/object/<object_path>\n\nWhen resources.type equals AWS::Lambda::Function , and the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals , the ARN must be in the following format:\n\narn:<partition>:lambda:<region>:<account_ID>:function:<function_name>\n\nWhen resources.type equals AWS::DynamoDB::Table , and the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals , the ARN must be in the following format:\n\narn:<partition>:dynamodb:<region>:<account_ID>:table:<table_name>\n\nWhen resources.type equals AWS::S3Outposts::Object , and the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals , the ARN must be in the following format:\n\narn:<partition>:s3-outposts:<region>:<account_ID>:<object_path>\n\nWhen resources.type equals AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node , and the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals , the ARN must be in the following format:\n\narn:<partition>:managedblockchain:<region>:<account_ID>:nodes/<node_ID>\n\nWhen resources.type equals AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint , and the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals , the ARN must be in the following format:\n\narn:<partition>:s3-object-lambda:<region>:<account_ID>:accesspoint/<access_point_name>\n\nWhen resources.type equals AWS::EC2::Snapshot , and the operator is set to Equals or NotEquals , the ARN must be in the following format:\n\narn:<partition>:ec2:<region>::snapshot/<snapshot_ID>\n\nEquals -> (list)\n\nAn operator that includes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of Field . This is the only valid operator that you can use with the readOnly , eventCategory , and resources.type fields.\n\n(string)\n\nStartsWith -> (list)\n\nAn operator that includes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of Field .\n\n(string)\n\nEndsWith -> (list)\n\nAn operator that includes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of Field .\n\n(string)\n\nNotEquals -> (list)\n\nAn operator that excludes events that match the exact value of the event record field specified as the value of Field .\n\n(string)\n\nNotStartsWith -> (list)\n\nAn operator that excludes events that match the first few characters of the event record field specified as the value of Field .\n\n(string)\n\nNotEndsWith -> (list)\n\nAn operator that excludes events that match the last few characters of the event record field specified as the value of Field .\n\n(string)",

This limit does not apply if you configure resource logging for all data events.\n\nFor more information, see Data Events and Limits in CloudTrail in the CloudTrail User Guide .\n\n(structure)\n\nThe Amazon S3 buckets, Lambda functions, or Amazon DynamoDB tables that you specify in your event selectors for your trail to log data events. Data events provide information about the resource operations performed on or within a resource itself. These are also known as data plane operations. You can specify up to 250 data resources for a trail.\n\nNote\n\nThe total number of allowed data resources is 250. This number can be distributed between 1 and 5 event selectors, but the total cannot exceed 250 across all selectors.\n\nIf you are using advanced event selectors, the maximum total number of values for all conditions, across all advanced event selectors for the trail, is 500.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of all data events for an S3 bucket named bucket-1 . In this example, the CloudTrail user specified an empty prefix, and the option to log both Read and Write data events.\n\nA user uploads an image file to bucket-1 .\n\nThe PutObject API operation is an Amazon S3 object-level API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified an S3 bucket with an empty prefix, events that occur on any object in that bucket are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.\n\nA user uploads an object to an Amazon S3 bucket named arn:aws:s3:::bucket-2 .\n\nThe PutObject API operation occurred for an object in an S3 bucket that the CloudTrail user didn’t specify for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.\n\nThe following example demonstrates how logging works when you configure logging of Lambda data events for a Lambda function named MyLambdaFunction , but not for all Lambda functions.\n\nA user runs a script that includes a call to the MyLambdaFunction function and the MyOtherLambdaFunction function.\n\nThe Invoke API operation on MyLambdaFunction is an Lambda API. It is recorded as a data event in CloudTrail. Because the CloudTrail user specified logging data events for MyLambdaFunction , any invocations of that function are logged. The trail processes and logs the event.\n\nThe Invoke API operation on MyOtherLambdaFunction is an Lambda API. Because the CloudTrail user did not specify logging data events for all Lambda functions, the Invoke operation for MyOtherLambdaFunction does not match the function specified for the trail. The trail doesn’t log the event.\n\nType -> (string)\n\nThe resource type in which you want to log data events. You can specify AWS::S3::Object , AWS::Lambda::Function , or AWS::DynamoDB::Table resources.\n\nThe AWS::S3Outposts::Object , AWS::ManagedBlockchain::Node , AWS::S3ObjectLambda::AccessPoint , and AWS::EC2::Snapshot resource types are not valid in basic event selectors. To log data events on these resource types, use advanced event selectors.\n\nValues -> (list)\n\nAn array of Amazon Resource Name (ARN) strings or partial ARN strings for the specified objects.\n\nTo log data events for all objects in all S3 buckets in your Amazon Web Services account, specify the prefix as arn:aws:s3::: .\n\nNote\n\nThis also enables logging of data event activity performed by any user or role in your Amazon Web Services account, even if that activity is performed on a bucket that belongs to another Amazon Web Services account.\n\nTo log data events for all objects in an S3 bucket, specify the bucket and an empty object prefix such as arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/ . The trail logs data events for all objects in this S3 bucket.\n\nTo log data events for specific objects, specify the S3 bucket and object prefix such as arn:aws:s3:::bucket-1/example-images . The trail logs data events for objects in this S3 bucket that match the prefix.\n\nTo log data events for all Lambda functions in your Amazon Web Services account, specify the prefix as arn:aws:lambda .\n\nNote\n\nThis also enables logging of Invoke activity performed by any user or role in your Amazon Web Services account, even if that activity is performed on a function that belongs to another Amazon Web Services account.\n\nTo log data events for a specific Lambda function, specify the function ARN.\n\nNote\n\nLambda function ARNs are exact. For example, if you specify a function ARN arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld , data events will only be logged for arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld . They will not be logged for arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:111111111111:function:helloworld2 .\n\nTo log data events for all DynamoDB tables in your Amazon Web Services account, specify the prefix as arn:aws:dynamodb .\n\n(string)\n\nExcludeManagementEventSources -> (list)\n\nAn optional list of service event sources from which you do not want management events to be logged on your trail. In this release, the list can be empty (disables the filter), or it can filter out Key Management Service or Amazon RDS Data API events by containing kms.amazonaws.com or rdsdata.amazonaws.com . By default, ExcludeManagementEventSources is empty, and KMS and Amazon RDS Data API events are logged to your trail.\n\n(string)\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"ReadWriteType\": \"ReadOnly\"|\"WriteOnly\"|\"All\",\n    \"IncludeManagementEvents\": true|false,\n    \"DataResources\": [\n      {\n        \"Type\": \"string\",\n        \"Values\": [\"string\", ...]\n      }\n      ...\n    ],\n    \"ExcludeManagementEventSources\": [\"string\", ...]\n  }\n  ...\n]\n\n\n--advanced-event-selectors (list)\n\nSpecifies the settings for advanced event selectors. You can add advanced event selectors, and conditions for your advanced event selectors, up to a maximum of 500 values for all conditions and selectors on a trail. You can use either AdvancedEventSelectors or EventSelectors , but not both. If you apply AdvancedEventSelectors to a trail, any existing EventSelectors are overwritten. For more information about advanced event selectors, see Logging data events for trails in the CloudTrail User Guide .\n\n(structure)\n\nAdvanced event selectors let you create fine-grained selectors for the following CloudTrail event record ﬁelds. They help you control costs by logging only those events that are important to you.

  "service_description": "Description\n\nThis is the CloudTrail API Reference. It provides descriptions of actions, data types, common parameters, and common errors for CloudTrail.\n\nCloudTrail is a web service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. The recorded information includes the identity of the user, the start time of the Amazon Web Services API call, the source IP address, the request parameters, and the response elements returned by the service.\n\nNote\n\nAs an alternative to the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide programmatic access to CloudTrail. For example, the SDKs handle cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools to Build on Amazon Web Services .\n\nSee the CloudTrail User Guide for information about the data that is included with each Amazon Web Services API call listed in the log files."
