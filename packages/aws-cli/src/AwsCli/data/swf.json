For example:\n\naws swf list-domains --registration-status DEPRECATED\n\n\nResult:\n\n{\n  \"domainInfos\": [\n    {\n      \"status\": \"DEPRECATED\",\n      \"name\": \"MyNeatNewDomain\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nIf you have many domains, you can set the --maximum-page-size option to limit the number of results returned. If there are more results to return than the maximum number that you specified, you will receive a nextPageToken that you can send to the next call to list-domains to retrieve additional entries.\n\nHere’s an example of using --maximum-page-size:\n\naws swf list-domains --registration-status REGISTERED --maximum-page-size 1\n\n\nResult:\n\n{\n  \"domainInfos\": [\n    {\n      \"status\": \"REGISTERED\",\n      \"name\": \"DataFrobotz\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"nextPageToken\": \"AAAAKgAAAAEAAAAAAAAAA2QJKNtidVgd49TTeNwYcpD+QKT2ynuEbibcQWe2QKrslMGe63gpS0MgZGpcpoKttL4OCXRFn98Xif557it+wSZUsvUDtImjDLvguyuyyFdIZtvIxIKEOPm3k2r4OjAGaFsGOuVbrKljvla7wdU7FYH3OlkNCP8b7PBj9SBkUyGoiAghET74P93AuVIIkdKGtQ==\"\n}\n\n\nWhen you make the call again, this time supplying the value of nextPageToken in the --next-page-token argument, you’ll get another page of results:\n\naws swf list-domains --registration-status REGISTERED --maximum-page-size 1 --next-page-token \"AAAAKgAAAAEAAAAAAAAAA2QJKNtidVgd49TTeNwYcpD+QKT2ynuEbibcQWe2QKrslMGe63gpS0MgZGpcpoKttL4OCXRFn98Xif557it+wSZUsvUDtImjDLvguyuyyFdIZtvIxIKEOPm3k2r4OjAGaFsGOuVbrKljvla7wdU7FYH3OlkNCP8b7PBj9SBkUyGoiAghET74P93AuVIIkdKGtQ==\"\n\n\nResult:\n\n{\n  \"domainInfos\": [\n    {\n      \"status\": \"REGISTERED\",\n      \"name\": \"erontest\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\n\nWhen there are no further pages of results to retrieve, nextPageToken will not be returned in the results.\n\nSee Also\n\nListDomains in the Amazon Simple Workflow Service API Reference"

Workflow execution data will not be retained after the specified number of days have passed.\n\nHere’s an example of registering a new domain:\n\n$ aws swf register-domain --name MyNeatNewDomain --workflow-execution-retention-period-in-days 0\n\"\"\n\n\nWhen you register a domain, nothing is returned (“”), but you can use swf list-domains or swf describe-domain to see the new domain.

See the docs for the Decision structure for details.\n\n(structure)\n\nSpecifies a decision made by the decider. A decision can be one of these types:\n\nCancelTimer – Cancels a previously started timer and records a TimerCanceled event in the history.\n\nCancelWorkflowExecution – Closes the workflow execution and records a WorkflowExecutionCanceled event in the history.\n\nCompleteWorkflowExecution – Closes the workflow execution and records a WorkflowExecutionCompleted event in the history .\n\nContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution – Closes the workflow execution and starts a new workflow execution of the same type using the same workflow ID and a unique run Id. A WorkflowExecutionContinuedAsNew event is recorded in the history.\n\nFailWorkflowExecution – Closes the workflow execution and records a WorkflowExecutionFailed event in the history.\n\nRecordMarker – Records a MarkerRecorded event in the history. Markers can be used for adding custom information in the history for instance to let deciders know that they don’t need to look at the history beyond the marker event.\n\nRequestCancelActivityTask – Attempts to cancel a previously scheduled activity task. If the activity task was scheduled but has not been assigned to a worker, then it is canceled. If the activity task was already assigned to a worker, then the worker is informed that cancellation has been requested in the response to RecordActivityTaskHeartbeat .\n\nRequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution – Requests that a request be made to cancel the specified external workflow execution and records a RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated event in the history.\n\nScheduleActivityTask – Schedules an activity task.\n\nSignalExternalWorkflowExecution – Requests a signal to be delivered to the specified external workflow execution and records a SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionInitiated event in the history.\n\nStartChildWorkflowExecution – Requests that a child workflow execution be started and records a StartChildWorkflowExecutionInitiated event in the history. The child workflow execution is a separate workflow execution with its own history.\n\nStartTimer – Starts a timer for this workflow execution and records a TimerStarted event in the history. This timer fires after the specified delay and record a TimerFired event.\n\nAccess Control\n\nIf you grant permission to use RespondDecisionTaskCompleted , you can use IAM policies to express permissions for the list of decisions returned by this action as if they were members of the API. Treating decisions as a pseudo API maintains a uniform conceptual model and helps keep policies readable. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .\n\nDecision Failure\n\nDecisions can fail for several reasons\n\nThe ordering of decisions should follow a logical flow. Some decisions might not make sense in the current context of the workflow execution and therefore fails.\n\nA limit on your account was reached.\n\nThe decision lacks sufficient permissions.\n\nOne of the following events might be added to the history to indicate an error. The event attribute’s cause parameter indicates the cause. If cause is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED , the decision failed because it lacked sufficient permissions. For details and example IAM policies, see Using IAM to Manage Access to Amazon SWF Workflows in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .\n\nScheduleActivityTaskFailed – A ScheduleActivityTask decision failed. This could happen if the activity type specified in the decision isn’t registered, is in a deprecated state, or the decision isn’t properly configured.\n\nRequestCancelActivityTaskFailed – A RequestCancelActivityTask decision failed. This could happen if there is no open activity task with the specified activityId.\n\nStartTimerFailed – A StartTimer decision failed. This could happen if there is another open timer with the same timerId.\n\nCancelTimerFailed – A CancelTimer decision failed. This could happen if there is no open timer with the specified timerId.\n\nStartChildWorkflowExecutionFailed – A StartChildWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the workflow type specified isn’t registered, is deprecated, or the decision isn’t properly configured.\n\nSignalExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed – A SignalExternalWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the workflowID specified in the decision was incorrect.\n\nRequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionFailed – A RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if the workflowID specified in the decision was incorrect.\n\nCancelWorkflowExecutionFailed – A CancelWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution.\n\nCompleteWorkflowExecutionFailed – A CompleteWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution.\n\nContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionFailed – A ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution or the ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution decision was not configured correctly.\n\nFailWorkflowExecutionFailed – A FailWorkflowExecution decision failed. This could happen if there is an unhandled decision task pending in the workflow execution.\n\nThe preceding error events might occur due to an error in the decider logic, which might put the workflow execution in an unstable state The cause field in the event structure for the error event indicates the cause of the error.\n\nNote\n\nA workflow execution may be closed by the decider by returning one of the following decisions when completing a decision task: CompleteWorkflowExecution , FailWorkflowExecution , CancelWorkflowExecution and ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecution . An UnhandledDecision fault is returned if a workflow closing decision is specified and a signal or activity event had been added to the history while the decision task was being performed by the decider. Unlike the above situations which are logic issues, this fault is always possible because of race conditions in a distributed system. The right action here is to call RespondDecisionTaskCompleted without any decisions. This would result in another decision task with these new events included in the history. The decider should handle the new events and may decide to close the workflow execution.\n\nHow to Code a Decision\n\nYou code a decision by first setting the decision type field to one of the above decision values, and then set the corresponding attributes field shown below:\n\n`` ScheduleActivityTaskDecisionAttributes ``\n\n`` RequestCancelActivityTaskDecisionAttributes ``\n\n`` CompleteWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``\n\n`` FailWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``\n\n`` CancelWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``\n\n`` ContinueAsNewWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``\n\n`` RecordMarkerDecisionAttributes ``\n\n`` StartTimerDecisionAttributes ``\n\n`` CancelTimerDecisionAttributes ``\n\n`` SignalExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``\n\n`` RequestCancelExternalWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``\n\n`` StartChildWorkflowExecutionDecisionAttributes ``\n\ndecisionType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the type of the decision.\n\nscheduleActivityTaskDecisionAttributes -> (structure)\n\nProvides the details of the ScheduleActivityTask decision.

You can use this to associate a custom identifier with the workflow execution. You may specify the same identifier if a workflow execution is logically a restart of a previous execution. You cannot have two open workflow executions with the same workflowId at the same time within the same domain.\n\nThe specified string must not start or end with whitespace. It must not contain a : (colon), / (slash), | (vertical bar), or any control characters (\\u0000-\\u001f | \\u007f-\\u009f ).

Valid values are integers that range from Java’s Integer.MIN_VALUE (-2147483648) to Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647). Higher numbers indicate higher priority.\n\nFor more information about setting task priority, see Setting Task Priority in the Amazon SWF Developer Guide .\n\n--input (string)\n\nThe input for the workflow execution. This is a free form string which should be meaningful to the workflow you are starting. This input is made available to the new workflow execution in the WorkflowExecutionStarted history event.\n\n--execution-start-to-close-timeout (string)\n\nThe total duration for this workflow execution. This overrides the defaultExecutionStartToCloseTimeout specified when registering the workflow type.\n\nThe duration is specified in seconds; an integer greater than or equal to 0 . Exceeding this limit causes the workflow execution to time out. Unlike some of the other timeout parameters in Amazon SWF, you cannot specify a value of “NONE” for this timeout; there is a one-year max limit on the time that a workflow execution can run.\n\nNote\n\nAn execution start-to-close timeout must be specified either through this parameter or as a default when the workflow type is registered. If neither this parameter nor a default execution start-to-close timeout is specified, a fault is returned.\n\n--tag-list (list)\n\nThe list of tags to associate with the workflow execution. You can specify a maximum of 5 tags. You can list workflow executions with a specific tag by calling ListOpenWorkflowExecutions or ListClosedWorkflowExecutions and specifying a TagFilter .\n\n(string)\n\nSyntax:\n\n\"string\" \"string\" ...\n\n\n--task-start-to-close-timeout (string)\n\nSpecifies the maximum duration of decision tasks for this workflow execution. This parameter overrides the defaultTaskStartToCloseTimout specified when registering the workflow type using RegisterWorkflowType .\n\nThe duration is specified in seconds, an integer greater than or equal to 0 . You can use NONE to specify unlimited duration.\n\nNote\n\nA task start-to-close timeout for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default task start-to-close timeout was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.\n\n--child-policy (string)\n\nIf set, specifies the policy to use for the child workflow executions of this workflow execution if it is terminated, by calling the TerminateWorkflowExecution action explicitly or due to an expired timeout. This policy overrides the default child policy specified when registering the workflow type using RegisterWorkflowType .\n\nThe supported child policies are:\n\nTERMINATE – The child executions are terminated.\n\nREQUEST_CANCEL – A request to cancel is attempted for each child execution by recording a WorkflowExecutionCancelRequested event in its history. It is up to the decider to take appropriate actions when it receives an execution history with this event.\n\nABANDON – No action is taken. The child executions continue to run.\n\nNote\n\nA child policy for this workflow execution must be specified either as a default for the workflow type or through this parameter. If neither this parameter is set nor a default child policy was specified at registration time then a fault is returned.\n\nPossible values:\n\nTERMINATE\n\nREQUEST_CANCEL\n\nABANDON\n\n--lambda-role (string)\n\nThe IAM role to attach to this workflow execution.\n\nNote\n\nExecutions of this workflow type need IAM roles to invoke Lambda functions. If you don’t attach an IAM role, any attempt to schedule a Lambda task fails. This results in a ScheduleLambdaFunctionFailed history event.

The key is swf:workflowType.name .\n\nworkflowType.version : String constraint. The key is swf:workflowType.version .\n\nIf the caller doesn’t have sufficient permissions to invoke the action, or the parameter values fall outside the specified constraints, the action fails. The associated event attribute’s cause parameter is set to OPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED .

In Amazon SWF, a task represents a logical unit of work that is performed by a component of your workflow. Coordinating tasks in a workflow involves managing intertask dependencies, scheduling, and concurrency in accordance with the logical flow of the application.\n\nAmazon SWF gives you full control over implementing tasks and coordinating them without worrying about underlying complexities such as tracking their progress and maintaining their state.\n\nThis documentation serves as reference only.
