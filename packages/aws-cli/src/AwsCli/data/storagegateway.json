SettlingTimeInSeconds controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it’s best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.\n\nNote\n\nSettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.\n\nThe following example sets NotificationPolicy on with SettlingTimeInSeconds set to 60.\n\n{\\\"Upload\\\": {\\\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\\\": 60}}\n\nThe following example sets NotificationPolicy off.\n\n{}\n\n--vpc-endpoint-dns-name (string)\n\nSpecifies the DNS name for the VPC endpoint that the SMB file share uses to connect to Amazon S3.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter is required for SMB file shares that connect to Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an access point alias that points to a VPC access point.\n\n--bucket-region (string)\n\nSpecifies the Region of the S3 bucket where the SMB file share stores files.\n\nNote\n\nThis parameter is required for SMB file shares that connect to Amazon S3 through a VPC endpoint, a VPC access point, or an access point alias that points to a VPC access point.\n\n--oplocks-enabled | --no-oplocks-enabled (boolean)\n\nSpecifies whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB file share.\n\nNote\n\nEnabling opportunistic locking on case-sensitive shares is not recommended for workloads that involve access to files with the same name in different case.\n\nValid Values: true | false\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.

This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json.

SettlingTimeInSeconds controls the number of seconds to wait after the last point in time a client wrote to a file before generating an ObjectUploaded notification. Because clients can make many small writes to files, it’s best to set this parameter for as long as possible to avoid generating multiple notifications for the same file in a small time period.\n\nNote\n\nSettlingTimeInSeconds has no effect on the timing of the object uploading to Amazon S3, only the timing of the notification.\n\nThe following example sets NotificationPolicy on with SettlingTimeInSeconds set to 60.\n\n{\\\"Upload\\\": {\\\"SettlingTimeInSeconds\\\": 60}}\n\nThe following example sets NotificationPolicy off.\n\n{}\n\n--oplocks-enabled | --no-oplocks-enabled (boolean)\n\nSpecifies whether opportunistic locking is enabled for the SMB file share.\n\nNote\n\nEnabling opportunistic locking on case-sensitive shares is not recommended for workloads that involve access to files with the same name in different case.\n\nValid Values: true | false\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided.

  "service_description": "Description\n\nStorage Gateway is the service that connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage to provide seamless and secure integration between an organization’s on-premises IT environment and the Amazon Web Services storage infrastructure. The service enables you to securely upload data to the Amazon Web Services Cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery.\n\nUse the following links to get started using the Storage Gateway Service API Reference :\n\nStorage Gateway required request headers : Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST request to Storage Gateway.\n\nSigning requests : Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you send; this topic describes how sign such a request.\n\nError responses : Provides reference information about Storage Gateway errors.\n\nOperations in Storage Gateway : Contains detailed descriptions of all Storage Gateway operations, their request parameters, response elements, possible errors, and examples of requests and responses.\n\nStorage Gateway endpoints and quotas : Provides a list of each Amazon Web Services Region and the endpoints available for use with Storage Gateway.\n\nNote\n\nStorage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might be vol-AA22BB012345DAF670 . When you use this ID with the EC2 API, you must change it to vol-aa22bb012345daf670 . Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected.\n\nWarning\n\nIDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character string. Starting in April 2016, you will be able to use these longer IDs so you can test your systems with the new format. For more information, see Longer EC2 and EBS resource IDs .\n\nFor example, a volume Amazon Resource Name (ARN) with the longer volume ID format looks like the following:\n\narn:aws:storagegateway:us-west-2:111122223333:gateway/sgw-12A3456B/volume/vol-1122AABBCCDDEEFFG .\n\nA snapshot ID with the longer ID format looks like the following: snap-78e226633445566ee .\n\nFor more information, see Announcement: Heads-up – Longer Storage Gateway volume and snapshot IDs coming in 2016 ."
