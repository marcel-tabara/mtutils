This does not affect the number of items returned in the command’s output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--max-items (integer)\n\nThe total number of items to return in the command’s output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command’s output. To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

If you call the AWS Health API from an AWS account that doesn’t have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a SubscriptionRequiredException error.\n\nYou can use the AWS Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) to call the AWS Health API operations. AWS Health supports a multi-Region application architecture and has two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration. You can use the high availability endpoint example to determine which AWS Region is active, so that you can get the latest information from the API. For more information, see Accessing the AWS Health API in the AWS Health User Guide .\n\nFor authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the Signature Version 4 Signing Process .\n\nIf your AWS account is part of AWS Organizations, you can use the AWS Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization. You can aggregate AWS Health events in real time to identify accounts in your organization that are affected by an operational event or get notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to enable this feature and return event information.
