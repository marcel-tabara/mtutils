The encryption contract defines which content keys are used to encrypt the audio and video tracks in your stream. To configure the encryption contract, specify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note the following considerations when using encryptionContractConfiguration: encryptionContractConfiguration can be used for DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification.

This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--max-items (integer)\n\nThe total number of items to return in the command’s output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command’s output. To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

Actual fragments will be rounded to the nearest multiple of the source fragment duration.\n\nStreamSelection -> (structure)\n\nA StreamSelection configuration.\n\nMaxVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)\n\nThe maximum video bitrate (bps) to include in output.\n\nMinVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)\n\nThe minimum video bitrate (bps) to include in output.\n\nStreamOrder -> (string)\n\nA directive that determines the order of streams in the output.\n\nUseAudioRenditionGroup -> (boolean)\n\nWhen enabled, audio streams will be placed in rendition groups in the output.\n\nId -> (string)\n\nThe ID of the OriginEndpoint.\n\nManifestName -> (string)\n\nA short string appended to the end of the OriginEndpoint URL.\n\nMssPackage -> (structure)\n\nA Microsoft Smooth Streaming (MSS) packaging configuration.\n\nEncryption -> (structure)\n\nA Microsoft Smooth Streaming (MSS) encryption configuration.\n\nSpekeKeyProvider -> (structure)\n\nA configuration for accessing an external Secure Packager and Encoder Key Exchange (SPEKE) service that will provide encryption keys.\n\nCertificateArn -> (string)\n\nAn Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of a Certificate Manager certificate that MediaPackage will use for enforcing secure end-to-end data transfer with the key provider service.\n\nEncryptionContractConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nUse encryptionContractConfiguration to configure one or more content encryption keys for your endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. The encryption contract defines which content keys are used to encrypt the audio and video tracks in your stream. To configure the encryption contract, specify which audio and video encryption presets to use. Note the following considerations when using encryptionContractConfiguration: encryptionContractConfiguration can be used for DASH or CMAF endpoints that use SPEKE 2.0. SPEKE 2.0 relies on the CPIX 2.3 specification. You must disable key rotation for this endpoint by setting keyRotationIntervalSeconds to 0.\n\nPresetSpeke20Audio -> (string)\n\nA collection of audio encryption presets.\n\nPresetSpeke20Video -> (string)\n\nA collection of video encryption presets.\n\nResourceId -> (string)\n\nThe resource ID to include in key requests.\n\nRoleArn -> (string)\n\nAn Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that AWS Elemental MediaPackage will assume when accessing the key provider service.\n\nSystemIds -> (list)\n\nThe system IDs to include in key requests.\n\n(string)\n\nUrl -> (string)\n\nThe URL of the external key provider service.\n\nManifestWindowSeconds -> (integer)\n\nThe time window (in seconds) contained in each manifest.\n\nSegmentDurationSeconds -> (integer)\n\nThe duration (in seconds) of each segment.\n\nStreamSelection -> (structure)\n\nA StreamSelection configuration.\n\nMaxVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)\n\nThe maximum video bitrate (bps) to include in output.\n\nMinVideoBitsPerSecond -> (integer)\n\nThe minimum video bitrate (bps) to include in output.\n\nStreamOrder -> (string)\n\nA directive that determines the order of streams in the output.\n\nOrigination -> (string)\n\nControl whether origination of video is allowed for this OriginEndpoint. If set to ALLOW, the OriginEndpoint may by requested, pursuant to any other form of access control. If set to DENY, the OriginEndpoint may not be requested. This can be helpful for Live to VOD harvesting, or for temporarily disabling origination\n\nStartoverWindowSeconds -> (integer)\n\nMaximum duration (seconds) of content to retain for startover playback. If not specified, startover playback will be disabled for the OriginEndpoint.\n\nTags -> (map)\n\nA collection of tags associated with a resource\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nTimeDelaySeconds -> (integer)\n\nAmount of delay (seconds) to enforce on the playback of live content. If not specified, there will be no time delay in effect for the OriginEndpoint.\n\nUrl -> (string)\n\nThe URL of the packaged OriginEndpoint for consumption.\n\nWhitelist -> (list)\n\nA list of source IP CIDR blocks that will be allowed to access the OriginEndpoint.\n\n(string)",
