After successfully uploading all relevant parts of an upload, you call this action to complete the upload. Upon receiving this request, Amazon S3 concatenates all the parts in ascending order by part number to create a new object. In the Complete Multipart Upload request, you must provide the parts list. You must ensure that the parts list is complete. This action concatenates the parts that you provide in the list. For each part in the list, you must provide the part number and the ETag value, returned after that part was uploaded.\n\nProcessing of a Complete Multipart Upload request could take several minutes to complete. After Amazon S3 begins processing the request, it sends an HTTP response header that specifies a 200 OK response. While processing is in progress, Amazon S3 periodically sends white space characters to keep the connection from timing out. Because a request could fail after the initial 200 OK response has been sent, it is important that you check the response body to determine whether the request succeeded.\n\nNote that if CompleteMultipartUpload fails, applications should be prepared to retry the failed requests.

      "command_description": "Description\n\nCreates a copy of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3.\n\nNote\n\nYou can store individual objects of up to 5 TB in Amazon S3. You create a copy of your object up to 5 GB in size in a single atomic action using this API. However, to copy an object greater than 5 GB, you must use the multipart upload Upload Part - Copy API. For more information, see Copy Object Using the REST Multipart Upload API .\n\nAll copy requests must be authenticated. Additionally, you must have read access to the source object and write access to the destination bucket. For more information, see REST Authentication . Both the Region that you want to copy the object from and the Region that you want to copy the object to must be enabled for your account.\n\nA copy request might return an error when Amazon S3 receives the copy request or while Amazon S3 is copying the files. If the error occurs before the copy action starts, you receive a standard Amazon S3 error. If the error occurs during the copy operation, the error response is embedded in the 200 OK response. This means that a 200 OK response can contain either a success or an error. Design your application to parse the contents of the response and handle it appropriately.\n\nIf the copy is successful, you receive a response with information about the copied object.\n\nNote\n\nIf the request is an HTTP 1.1 request, the response is chunk encoded. If it were not, it would not contain the content-length, and you would need to read the entire body.\n\nThe copy request charge is based on the storage class and Region that you specify for the destination object. For pricing information, see Amazon S3 pricing .\n\nWarning\n\nAmazon S3 transfer acceleration does not support cross-Region copies. If you request a cross-Region copy using a transfer acceleration endpoint, you get a 400 Bad Request error. For more information, see Transfer Acceleration .\n\nMetadata\n\nWhen copying an object, you can preserve all metadata (default) or specify new metadata. However, the ACL is not preserved and is set to private for the user making the request. To override the default ACL setting, specify a new ACL when generating a copy request. For more information, see Using ACLs .\n\nTo specify whether you want the object metadata copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request, you can optionally add the x-amz-metadata-directive header. When you grant permissions, you can use the s3:x-amz-metadata-directive condition key to enforce certain metadata behavior when objects are uploaded. For more information, see Specifying Conditions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide . For a complete list of Amazon S3-specific condition keys, see Actions, Resources, and Condition Keys for Amazon S3 .\n\n** x-amz-copy-source-if Headers**\n\nTo only copy an object under certain conditions, such as whether the Etag matches or whether the object was modified before or after a specified date, use the following request parameters:\n\nx-amz-copy-source-if-match\n\nx-amz-copy-source-if-none-match\n\nx-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since\n\nx-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since\n\nIf both the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data:\n\nx-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true\n\nx-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false\n\nIf both the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the request and evaluate as follows, Amazon S3 returns the 412 Precondition Failed response code:\n\nx-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false\n\nx-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true\n\nNote\n\nAll headers with the x-amz- prefix, including x-amz-copy-source , must be signed.\n\nServer-side encryption\n\nWhen you perform a CopyObject operation, you can optionally use the appropriate encryption-related headers to encrypt the object using server-side encryption with Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS) or a customer-provided encryption key. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. For more information about server-side encryption, see Using Server-Side Encryption .\n\nIf a target object uses SSE-KMS, you can enable an S3 Bucket Key for the object. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Keys in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nAccess Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers\n\nWhen copying an object, you can optionally use headers to grant ACL-based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API .\n\nStorage Class Options\n\nYou can use the CopyObject action to change the storage class of an object that is already stored in Amazon S3 using the StorageClass parameter. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nVersioning\n\nBy default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of an object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted. To copy a different version, use the versionId subresource.\n\nIf you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the x-amz-version-id response header in the response.\n\nIf you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.\n\nIf the source object’s storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation. For more information, see RestoreObject .\n\nThe following operations are related to CopyObject :\n\nPutObject\n\nGetObject\n\nFor more information, see Copying Objects .\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\n--cache-control (string)\n\nSpecifies caching behavior along the request/reply chain.\n\n--content-disposition (string)\n\nSpecifies presentational information for the object.\n\n--content-encoding (string)\n\nSpecifies what content encodings have been applied to the object and thus what decoding mechanisms must be applied to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header field.\n\n--content-language (string)\n\nThe language the content is in.\n\n--content-type (string)\n\nA standard MIME type describing the format of the object data.\n\n--copy-source (string)\n\nSpecifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an access point :\n\nFor objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and the key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf from the bucket awsexamplebucket , use awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.\n\nFor objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key> . For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through access point my-access-point owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2 , use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.\n\nNote\n\nAmazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region.\n\nAlternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key> . For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2 , use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.\n\nTo copy a specific version of an object, append ?versionId=<version-id> to the value (for example, awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893 ). If you don’t specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object.\n\n--copy-source-if-match (string)\n\nCopies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.\n\n--copy-source-if-modified-since (timestamp)\n\nCopies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.\n\n--copy-source-if-none-match (string)\n\nCopies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the specified ETag.\n\n--copy-source-if-unmodified-since (timestamp)\n\nCopies the object if it hasn’t been modified since the specified time.\n\n--expires (timestamp)\n\nThe date and time at which the object is no longer cacheable.\n\n--grant-full-control (string)\n\nGives the grantee READ, READ_ACP, and WRITE_ACP permissions on the object.\n\nThis action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.\n\n--grant-read (string)\n\nAllows grantee to read the object data and its metadata.\n\nThis action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.\n\n--grant-read-acp (string)\n\nAllows grantee to read the object ACL.\n\nThis action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.\n\n--grant-write-acp (string)\n\nAllows grantee to write the ACL for the applicable object.\n\nThis action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.\n\n--key (string)\n\nThe key of the destination object.\n\n--metadata (map)\n\nA map of metadata to store with the object in S3.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (string)\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nKeyName1=string,KeyName2=string\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\"string\": \"string\"\n  ...}\n\n\n--metadata-directive (string)\n\nSpecifies whether the metadata is copied from the source object or replaced with metadata provided in the request.\n\nPossible values:\n\nCOPY\n\nREPLACE\n\n--tagging-directive (string)\n\nSpecifies whether the object tag-set are copied from the source object or replaced with tag-set provided in the request.\n\nPossible values:\n\nCOPY\n\nREPLACE\n\n--server-side-encryption (string)\n\nThe server-side encryption algorithm used when storing this object in Amazon S3 (for example, AES256, aws:kms).\n\nPossible values:\n\nAES256\n\naws:kms\n\n--storage-class (string)\n\nBy default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nPossible values:\n\nSTANDARD\n\nREDUCED_REDUNDANCY\n\nSTANDARD_IA\n\nONEZONE_IA\n\nINTELLIGENT_TIERING\n\nGLACIER\n\nDEEP_ARCHIVE\n\nOUTPOSTS\n\n--website-redirect-location (string)\n\nIf the bucket is configured as a website, redirects requests for this object to another object in the same bucket or to an external URL.

This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header.\n\n--sse-customer-key-md5 (string)\n\nSpecifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.\n\n--ssekms-key-id (string)\n\nSpecifies the Amazon Web Services KMS key ID to use for object encryption. All GET and PUT requests for an object protected by Amazon Web Services KMS will fail if not made via SSL or using SigV4. For information about configuring using any of the officially supported Amazon Web Services SDKs and Amazon Web Services CLI, see Specifying the Signature Version in Request Authentication in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\n--ssekms-encryption-context (string)\n\nSpecifies the Amazon Web Services KMS Encryption Context to use for object encryption. The value of this header is a base64-encoded UTF-8 string holding JSON with the encryption context key-value pairs.\n\n--bucket-key-enabled | --no-bucket-key-enabled (boolean)\n\nSpecifies whether Amazon S3 should use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with server-side encryption using AWS KMS (SSE-KMS). Setting this header to true causes Amazon S3 to use an S3 Bucket Key for object encryption with SSE-KMS.\n\nSpecifying this header with a COPY action doesn’t affect bucket-level settings for S3 Bucket Key.\n\n--copy-source-sse-customer-algorithm (string)\n\nSpecifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for example, AES256).\n\n--copy-source-sse-customer-key (string)\n\nSpecifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source object.

Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.\n\n--request-payer (string)\n\nConfirms that the requester knows that they will be charged for the request. Bucket owners need not specify this parameter in their requests. For information about downloading objects from requester pays buckets, see Downloading Objects in Requestor Pays Buckets in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nPossible values:\n\nrequester\n\n--tagging (string)\n\nThe tag-set for the object destination object this value must be used in conjunction with the TaggingDirective . The tag-set must be encoded as URL Query parameters.\n\n--object-lock-mode (string)\n\nThe Object Lock mode that you want to apply to the copied object.\n\nPossible values:\n\nGOVERNANCE\n\nCOMPLIANCE\n\n--object-lock-retain-until-date (timestamp)\n\nThe date and time when you want the copied object’s Object Lock to expire.\n\n--object-lock-legal-hold-status (string)\n\nSpecifies whether you want to apply a Legal Hold to the copied object.\n\nPossible values:\n\nON\n\nOFF\n\n--expected-bucket-owner (string)\n\nThe account ID of the expected destination bucket owner. If the destination bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Access Denied) error.\n\n--expected-source-bucket-owner (string)\n\nThe account ID of the expected source bucket owner. If the source bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Access Denied) error.\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

      "command_description": "Description\n\nCreates a new S3 bucket. To create a bucket, you must register with Amazon S3 and have a valid Amazon Web Services Access Key ID to authenticate requests. Anonymous requests are never allowed to create buckets. By creating the bucket, you become the bucket owner.\n\nNot every string is an acceptable bucket name. For information about bucket naming restrictions, see Bucket naming rules .\n\nIf you want to create an Amazon S3 on Outposts bucket, see Create Bucket .\n\nBy default, the bucket is created in the US East (N. Virginia) Region. You can optionally specify a Region in the request body. You might choose a Region to optimize latency, minimize costs, or address regulatory requirements. For example, if you reside in Europe, you will probably find it advantageous to create buckets in the Europe (Ireland) Region. For more information, see Accessing a bucket .\n\nNote\n\nIf you send your create bucket request to the s3.amazonaws.com endpoint, the request goes to the us-east-1 Region. Accordingly, the signature calculations in Signature Version 4 must use us-east-1 as the Region, even if the location constraint in the request specifies another Region where the bucket is to be created. If you create a bucket in a Region other than US East (N. Virginia), your application must be able to handle 307 redirect. For more information, see Virtual hosting of buckets .\n\nWhen creating a bucket using this operation, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the bucket. There are two ways to grant the appropriate permissions using the request headers.\n\nSpecify a canned ACL using the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL .\n\nSpecify access permissions explicitly using the x-amz-grant-read , x-amz-grant-write , x-amz-grant-read-acp , x-amz-grant-write-acp , and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These headers map to the set of permissions Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access control list (ACL) overview . You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:\n\nid – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account\n\nuri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group\n\nemailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account\n\nNote\n\nUsing email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:\n\nUS East (N. Virginia)\n\nUS West (N. California)\n\nUS West (Oregon)\n\nAsia Pacific (Singapore)\n\nAsia Pacific (Sydney)\n\nAsia Pacific (Tokyo)\n\nEurope (Ireland)\n\nSouth America (São Paulo)\n\nFor a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.\n\nFor example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants the Amazon Web Services accounts identified by account IDs permissions to read object data and its metadata:\n\nx-amz-grant-read: id=\"11112222333\", id=\"444455556666\"\n\nNote\n\nYou can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.\n\nPermissions\n\nIf your CreateBucket request specifies ACL permissions and the ACL is public-read, public-read-write, authenticated-read, or if you specify access permissions explicitly through any other ACL, both s3:CreateBucket and s3:PutBucketAcl permissions are needed. If the ACL the CreateBucket request is private, only s3:CreateBucket permission is needed.\n\nIf ObjectLockEnabledForBucket is set to true in your CreateBucket request, s3:PutBucketObjectLockConfiguration and s3:PutBucketVersioning permissions are required.\n\nThe following operations are related to CreateBucket :\n\nPutObject\n\nDeleteBucket\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

      "command_name": "create-multipart-upload",
      "command_url": "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/create-multipart-upload.html",
      "command_description": "Description\n\nThis action initiates a multipart upload and returns an upload ID. This upload ID is used to associate all of the parts in the specific multipart upload. You specify this upload ID in each of your subsequent upload part requests (see UploadPart ). You also include this upload ID in the final request to either complete or abort the multipart upload request.\n\nFor more information about multipart uploads, see Multipart Upload Overview .\n\nIf you have configured a lifecycle rule to abort incomplete multipart uploads, the upload must complete within the number of days specified in the bucket lifecycle configuration. Otherwise, the incomplete multipart upload becomes eligible for an abort action and Amazon S3 aborts the multipart upload. For more information, see Aborting Incomplete Multipart Uploads Using a Bucket Lifecycle Policy .\n\nFor information about the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions .\n\nFor request signing, multipart upload is just a series of regular requests. You initiate a multipart upload, send one or more requests to upload parts, and then complete the multipart upload process. You sign each request individually. There is nothing special about signing multipart upload requests. For more information about signing, see Authenticating Requests (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) .\n\nNote\n\nAfter you initiate a multipart upload and upload one or more parts, to stop being charged for storing the uploaded parts, you must either complete or abort the multipart upload. Amazon S3 frees up the space used to store the parts and stop charging you for storing them only after you either complete or abort a multipart upload.\n\nYou can optionally request server-side encryption. For server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. You can provide your own encryption key, or use Amazon Web Services KMS keys or Amazon S3-managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in UploadPart and UploadPartCopy requests must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using CreateMultipartUpload .\n\nTo perform a multipart upload with encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key, the requester must have permission to the kms:Decrypt and kms:GenerateDataKey* actions on the key. These permissions are required because Amazon S3 must decrypt and read data from the encrypted file parts before it completes the multipart upload. For more information, see Multipart upload API and permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nIf your Identity and Access Management (IAM) user or role is in the same Amazon Web Services account as the KMS key, then you must have these permissions on the key policy. If your IAM user or role belongs to a different account than the key, then you must have the permissions on both the key policy and your IAM user or role.\n\nFor more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption .\n\nAccess Permissions\n\nWhen copying an object, you can optionally specify the accounts or groups that should be granted specific permissions on the new object. There are two ways to grant the permissions using the request headers:\n\nSpecify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. For more information, see Canned ACL .\n\nSpecify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read , x-amz-grant-read-acp , x-amz-grant-write-acp , and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview .\n\nYou can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.\n\nServer-Side- Encryption-Specific Request Headers\n\nYou can optionally tell Amazon S3 to encrypt data at rest using server-side encryption. Server-side encryption is for data encryption at rest. Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it when you access it. The option you use depends on whether you want to use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys or provide your own encryption key.\n\nUse encryption keys managed by Amazon S3 or customer managed key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (Amazon Web Services KMS) – If you want Amazon Web Services to manage the keys used to encrypt data, specify the following headers in the request.\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-context\n\nNote\n\nIf you specify x-amz-server-side-encryption:aws:kms , but don’t provide x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id , Amazon S3 uses the Amazon Web Services managed key in Amazon Web Services KMS to protect the data.\n\nWarning\n\nAll GET and PUT requests for an object protected by Amazon Web Services KMS fail if you don’t make them with SSL or by using SigV4.\n\nFor more information about server-side encryption with KMS key (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys .\n\nUse customer-provided encryption keys – If you want to manage your own encryption keys, provide all the following headers in the request.\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5\n\nFor more information about server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS), see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with KMS keys .\n\nAccess-Control-List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers\n\nYou also can use the following access control–related headers with this operation. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the access control list (ACL) on the object. For more information, see Using ACLs . With this operation, you can grant access permissions using one of the following two methods:\n\nSpecify a canned ACL (x-amz-acl ) — Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. For more information, see Canned ACL .\n\nSpecify access permissions explicitly — To explicitly grant access permissions to specific Amazon Web Services accounts or groups, use the following headers. Each header maps to specific permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview . In the header, you specify a list of grantees who get the specific permission. To grant permissions explicitly, use:\n\nx-amz-grant-read\n\nx-amz-grant-write\n\nx-amz-grant-read-acp\n\nx-amz-grant-write-acp\n\nx-amz-grant-full-control\n\nYou specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:\n\nid – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account\n\nuri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group\n\nemailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account\n\nNote\n\nUsing email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:\n\nUS East (N.

      "command_description": "Description\n\nThis action enables you to delete multiple objects from a bucket using a single HTTP request. If you know the object keys that you want to delete, then this action provides a suitable alternative to sending individual delete requests, reducing per-request overhead.\n\nThe request contains a list of up to 1000 keys that you want to delete. In the XML, you provide the object key names, and optionally, version IDs if you want to delete a specific version of the object from a versioning-enabled bucket. For each key, Amazon S3 performs a delete action and returns the result of that delete, success, or failure, in the response. Note that if the object specified in the request is not found, Amazon S3 returns the result as deleted.\n\nThe action supports two modes for the response: verbose and quiet. By default, the action uses verbose mode in which the response includes the result of deletion of each key in your request. In quiet mode the response includes only keys where the delete action encountered an error. For a successful deletion, the action does not return any information about the delete in the response body.\n\nWhen performing this action on an MFA Delete enabled bucket, that attempts to delete any versioned objects, you must include an MFA token. If you do not provide one, the entire request will fail, even if there are non-versioned objects you are trying to delete. If you provide an invalid token, whether there are versioned keys in the request or not, the entire Multi-Object Delete request will fail. For information about MFA Delete, see MFA Delete .\n\nFinally, the Content-MD5 header is required for all Multi-Object Delete requests. Amazon S3 uses the header value to ensure that your request body has not been altered in transit.\n\nThe following operations are related to DeleteObjects :\n\nCreateMultipartUpload\n\nUploadPart\n\nCompleteMultipartUpload\n\nListParts\n\nAbortMultipartUpload\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

The maximum size of a replication configuration is 2 MB.\n\nRole -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) role that Amazon S3 assumes when replicating objects. For more information, see How to Set Up Replication in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nRules -> (list)\n\nA container for one or more replication rules. A replication configuration must have at least one rule and can contain a maximum of 1,000 rules.\n\n(structure)\n\nSpecifies which Amazon S3 objects to replicate and where to store the replicas.\n\nID -> (string)\n\nA unique identifier for the rule. The maximum value is 255 characters.\n\nPriority -> (integer)\n\nThe priority indicates which rule has precedence whenever two or more replication rules conflict. Amazon S3 will attempt to replicate objects according to all replication rules. However, if there are two or more rules with the same destination bucket, then objects will be replicated according to the rule with the highest priority. The higher the number, the higher the priority.\n\nFor more information, see Replication in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nPrefix -> (string)\n\nAn object key name prefix that identifies the object or objects to which the rule applies. The maximum prefix length is 1,024 characters. To include all objects in a bucket, specify an empty string.\n\nWarning\n\nReplacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests. For more information, see XML related object key constraints .\n\nFilter -> (structure)\n\nA filter that identifies the subset of objects to which the replication rule applies. A Filter must specify exactly one Prefix , Tag , or an And child element.\n\nPrefix -> (string)\n\nAn object key name prefix that identifies the subset of objects to which the rule applies.\n\nWarning\n\nReplacement must be made for object keys containing special characters (such as carriage returns) when using XML requests.

The filters determine the subset of objects to which the rule applies. This element is required only if you specify more than one filter. For example:\n\nIf you specify both a Prefix and a Tag filter, wrap these filters in an And tag.\n\nIf you specify a filter based on multiple tags, wrap the Tag elements in an And tag.\n\nPrefix -> (string)\n\nAn object key name prefix that identifies the subset of objects to which the rule applies.\n\nTags -> (list)\n\nAn array of tags containing key and value pairs.\n\n(structure)\n\nA container of a key value name pair.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nName of the object key.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nValue of the tag.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nSpecifies whether the rule is enabled.\n\nSourceSelectionCriteria -> (structure)\n\nA container that describes additional filters for identifying the source objects that you want to replicate. You can choose to enable or disable the replication of these objects. Currently, Amazon S3 supports only the filter that you can specify for objects created with server-side encryption using a customer managed key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS).\n\nSseKmsEncryptedObjects -> (structure)\n\nA container for filter information for the selection of Amazon S3 objects encrypted with Amazon Web Services KMS. If you include SourceSelectionCriteria in the replication configuration, this element is required.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nSpecifies whether Amazon S3 replicates objects created with server-side encryption using an Amazon Web Services KMS key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service.\n\nReplicaModifications -> (structure)\n\nA filter that you can specify for selections for modifications on replicas. Amazon S3 doesn’t replicate replica modifications by default. In the latest version of replication configuration (when Filter is specified), you can specify this element and set the status to Enabled to replicate modifications on replicas.\n\nNote\n\nIf you don’t specify the Filter element, Amazon S3 assumes that the replication configuration is the earlier version, V1. In the earlier version, this element is not allowed\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nSpecifies whether Amazon S3 replicates modifications on replicas.\n\nExistingObjectReplication -> (structure)\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nDestination -> (structure)\n\nA container for information about the replication destination and its configurations including enabling the S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC).\n\nBucket -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the bucket where you want Amazon S3 to store the results.\n\nAccount -> (string)\n\nDestination bucket owner account ID. In a cross-account scenario, if you direct Amazon S3 to change replica ownership to the Amazon Web Services account that owns the destination bucket by specifying the AccessControlTranslation property, this is the account ID of the destination bucket owner. For more information, see Replication Additional Configuration: Changing the Replica Owner in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nStorageClass -> (string)\n\nThe storage class to use when replicating objects, such as S3 Standard or reduced redundancy. By default, Amazon S3 uses the storage class of the source object to create the object replica.\n\nFor valid values, see the StorageClass element of the PUT Bucket replication action in the Amazon S3 API Reference .\n\nAccessControlTranslation -> (structure)\n\nSpecify this only in a cross-account scenario (where source and destination bucket owners are not the same), and you want to change replica ownership to the Amazon Web Services account that owns the destination bucket. If this is not specified in the replication configuration, the replicas are owned by same Amazon Web Services account that owns the source object.\n\nOwner -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the replica ownership. For default and valid values, see PUT bucket replication in the Amazon S3 API Reference .\n\nEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nA container that provides information about encryption. If SourceSelectionCriteria is specified, you must specify this element.\n\nReplicaKmsKeyID -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the ID (Key ARN or Alias ARN) of the customer managed Amazon Web Services KMS key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) for the destination bucket. Amazon S3 uses this key to encrypt replica objects. Amazon S3 only supports symmetric, customer managed KMS keys. For more information, see Using symmetric and asymmetric keys in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide .\n\nReplicationTime -> (structure)\n\nA container specifying S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC), including whether S3 RTC is enabled and the time when all objects and operations on objects must be replicated. Must be specified together with a Metrics block.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nSpecifies whether the replication time is enabled.\n\nTime -> (structure)\n\nA container specifying the time by which replication should be complete for all objects and operations on objects.\n\nMinutes -> (integer)\n\nContains an integer specifying time in minutes.\n\nValid value: 15\n\nMetrics -> (structure)\n\nA container specifying replication metrics-related settings enabling replication metrics and events.\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nSpecifies whether the replication metrics are enabled.\n\nEventThreshold -> (structure)\n\nA container specifying the time threshold for emitting the s3:Replication:OperationMissedThreshold event.\n\nMinutes -> (integer)\n\nContains an integer specifying time in minutes.\n\nValid value: 15\n\nDeleteMarkerReplication -> (structure)\n\nSpecifies whether Amazon S3 replicates delete markers. If you specify a Filter in your replication configuration, you must also include a DeleteMarkerReplication element. If your Filter includes a Tag element, the DeleteMarkerReplication Status must be set to Disabled, because Amazon S3 does not support replicating delete markers for tag-based rules. For an example configuration, see Basic Rule Configuration .\n\nFor more information about delete marker replication, see Basic Rule Configuration .\n\nNote\n\nIf you are using an earlier version of the replication configuration, Amazon S3 handles replication of delete markers differently. For more information, see Backward Compatibility .\n\nStatus -> (string)\n\nIndicates whether to replicate delete markers.\n\nNote\n\nIndicates whether to replicate delete markers.",

For more information about request types, see HTTP Host Header Bucket Specification .\n\nTo distribute large files to many people, you can save bandwidth costs by using BitTorrent. For more information, see Amazon S3 Torrent . For more information about returning the ACL of an object, see GetObjectAcl .\n\nIf the object you are retrieving is stored in the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers, before you can retrieve the object you must first restore a copy using RestoreObject . Otherwise, this action returns an InvalidObjectStateError error. For information about restoring archived objects, see Restoring Archived Objects .\n\nEncryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption , should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.\n\nIf you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you GET the object, you must use the following headers:\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5\n\nFor more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) .\n\nAssuming you have the relevant permission to read object tags, the response also returns the x-amz-tagging-count header that provides the count of number of tags associated with the object. You can use GetObjectTagging to retrieve the tag set associated with an object.\n\nPermissions\n\nYou need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation. For more information, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy . If the object you request does not exist, the error Amazon S3 returns depends on whether you also have the s3:ListBucket permission.\n\nIf you have the s3:ListBucket permission on the bucket, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 404 (“no such key”) error.\n\nIf you don’t have the s3:ListBucket permission, Amazon S3 will return an HTTP status code 403 (“access denied”) error.\n\nVersioning\n\nBy default, the GET action returns the current version of an object. To return a different version, use the versionId subresource.\n\nNote\n\nYou need the s3:GetObjectVersion permission to access a specific version of an object.\n\nIf the current version of the object is a delete marker, Amazon S3 behaves as if the object was deleted and includes x-amz-delete-marker: true in the response.\n\nFor more information about versioning, see PutBucketVersioning .\n\nOverriding Response Header Values\n\nThere are times when you want to override certain response header values in a GET response. For example, you might override the Content-Disposition response header value in your GET request.\n\nYou can override values for a set of response headers using the following query parameters. These response header values are sent only on a successful request, that is, when status code 200 OK is returned. The set of headers you can override using these parameters is a subset of the headers that Amazon S3 accepts when you create an object. The response headers that you can override for the GET response are Content-Type , Content-Language , Expires , Cache-Control , Content-Disposition , and Content-Encoding . To override these header values in the GET response, you use the following request parameters.\n\nNote\n\nYou must sign the request, either using an Authorization header or a presigned URL, when using these parameters. They cannot be used with an unsigned (anonymous) request.\n\nresponse-content-type\n\nresponse-content-language\n\nresponse-expires\n\nresponse-cache-control\n\nresponse-content-disposition\n\nresponse-content-encoding\n\nAdditional Considerations about Request Headers\n\nIf both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows: If-Match condition evaluates to true , and; If-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false ; then, S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.\n\nIf both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows:If-None-Match condition evaluates to false , and; If-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true ; then, S3 returns 304 Not Modified response code.\n\nFor more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .\n\nThe following operations are related to GetObject :\n\nListBuckets\n\nGetObjectAcl\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

It is not possible to retrieve the exact exception beyond these error codes.\n\nIf you encrypt an object by using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C) when you store the object in Amazon S3, then when you retrieve the metadata from the object, you must use the following headers:\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5\n\nFor more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) .\n\nNote\n\nEncryption request headers, like x-amz-server-side-encryption , should not be sent for GET requests if your object uses server-side encryption with KMS keys (SSE-KMS) or server-side encryption with Amazon S3–managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). If your object does use these types of keys, you’ll get an HTTP 400 BadRequest error.\n\nThe last modified property in this case is the creation date of the object.\n\nRequest headers are limited to 8 KB in size. For more information, see Common Request Headers .\n\nConsider the following when using request headers:\n\nConsideration 1 – If both of the If-Match and If-Unmodified-Since headers are present in the request as follows:\n\nIf-Match condition evaluates to true , and;\n\nIf-Unmodified-Since condition evaluates to false ;\n\nThen Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and the data requested.\n\nConsideration 2 – If both of the If-None-Match and If-Modified-Since headers are present in the request as follows:\n\nIf-None-Match condition evaluates to false , and;\n\nIf-Modified-Since condition evaluates to true ;\n\nThen Amazon S3 returns the 304 Not Modified response code.\n\nFor more information about conditional requests, see RFC 7232 .\n\nPermissions\n\nYou need the relevant read object (or version) permission for this operation.

When you request an object (GetObject ) or object metadata (HeadObject ) from these buckets, Amazon S3 will return the x-amz-replication-status header in the response as follows:\n\nIf requesting an object from the source bucket — Amazon S3 will return the x-amz-replication-status header if the object in your request is eligible for replication. For example, suppose that in your replication configuration, you specify object prefix TaxDocs requesting Amazon S3 to replicate objects with key prefix TaxDocs . Any objects you upload with this key name prefix, for example TaxDocs/document1.pdf , are eligible for replication. For any object request with this key name prefix, Amazon S3 will return the x-amz-replication-status header with value PENDING, COMPLETED or FAILED indicating object replication status.\n\nIf requesting an object from a destination bucket — Amazon S3 will return the x-amz-replication-status header with value REPLICA if the object in your request is a replica that Amazon S3 created and there is no replica modification replication in progress.\n\nWhen replicating objects to multiple destination buckets the x-amz-replication-status header acts differently. The header of the source object will only return a value of COMPLETED when replication is successful to all destinations. The header will remain at value PENDING until replication has completed for all destinations. If one or more destinations fails replication the header will return FAILED.\n\nFor more information, see Replication .\n\nPartsCount -> (integer)\n\nThe count of parts this object has.\n\nObjectLockMode -> (string)\n\nThe Object Lock mode, if any, that’s in effect for this object. This header is only returned if the requester has the s3:GetObjectRetention permission. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see Object Lock .\n\nObjectLockRetainUntilDate -> (timestamp)\n\nThe date and time when the Object Lock retention period expires. This header is only returned if the requester has the s3:GetObjectRetention permission.\n\nObjectLockLegalHoldStatus -> (string)\n\nSpecifies whether a legal hold is in effect for this object. This header is only returned if the requester has the s3:GetObjectLegalHold permission. This header is not returned if the specified version of this object has never had a legal hold applied. For more information about S3 Object Lock, see Object Lock .",

All keys that contain the same string between the prefix and the first occurrence of the delimiter are grouped under a single result element in CommonPrefixes. These groups are counted as one result against the max-keys limitation. These keys are not returned elsewhere in the response.\n\n--encoding-type (string)\n\nRequests Amazon S3 to encode the object keys in the response and specifies the encoding method to use. An object key may contain any Unicode character; however, XML 1.0 parser cannot parse some characters, such as characters with an ASCII value from 0 to 10. For characters that are not supported in XML 1.0, you can add this parameter to request that Amazon S3 encode the keys in the response.\n\nPossible values:\n\nurl\n\n--prefix (string)\n\nUse this parameter to select only those keys that begin with the specified prefix. You can use prefixes to separate a bucket into different groupings of keys. (You can think of using prefix to make groups in the same way you’d use a folder in a file system.) You can use prefix with delimiter to roll up numerous objects into a single result under CommonPrefixes.\n\n--expected-bucket-owner (string)\n\nThe account ID of the expected bucket owner. If the bucket is owned by a different account, the request will fail with an HTTP 403 (Access Denied) error.\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--starting-token (string)\n\nA token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--page-size (integer)\n\nThe size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command’s output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--max-items (integer)\n\nThe total number of items to return in the command’s output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command’s output. To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have WRITE_ACP permission.\n\nYou can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket’s permissions:\n\nSpecify the ACL in the request body\n\nSpecify permissions using request headers\n\nNote\n\nYou cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.\n\nDepending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, then you can continue to use that approach.\n\nAccess Permissions\n\nYou can set access permissions using one of the following methods:\n\nSpecify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs . Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-acl . If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL .\n\nSpecify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read , x-amz-grant-read-acp , x-amz-grant-write-acp , and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview . You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:\n\nid – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account\n\nuri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group\n\nemailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account\n\nNote\n\nUsing email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:\n\nUS East (N. Virginia)\n\nUS West (N. California)\n\nUS West (Oregon)\n\nAsia Pacific (Singapore)\n\nAsia Pacific (Sydney)\n\nAsia Pacific (Tokyo)\n\nEurope (Ireland)\n\nSouth America (São Paulo)\n\nFor a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.\n\nFor example, the following x-amz-grant-write header grants create, overwrite, and delete objects permission to LogDelivery group predefined by Amazon S3 and two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.\n\nx-amz-grant-write: uri=\"http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/s3/LogDelivery\", id=\"111122223333\", id=\"555566667777\"\n\nYou can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.\n\nGrantee Values\n\nYou can specify the person (grantee) to whom you’re assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:\n\nBy the person’s ID: <Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"CanonicalUser\"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee> DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request\n\nBy URI: <Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"Group\"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>\n\nBy Email address: <Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"AmazonCustomerByEmail\"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee> The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.\n\nNote\n\nUsing email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:\n\nUS East (N. Virginia)\n\nUS West (N. California)\n\nUS West (Oregon)\n\nAsia Pacific (Singapore)\n\nAsia Pacific (Sydney)\n\nAsia Pacific (Tokyo)\n\nEurope (Ireland)\n\nSouth America (São Paulo)\n\nFor a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.\n\nRelated Resources\n\nCreateBucket\n\nDeleteBucket\n\nGetObjectAcl\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

The document is limited to 64 KB in size.\n\nWhen Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the cors configuration on the bucket and uses the first CORSRule rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request.

In a cross-account scenario, if you direct Amazon S3 to change replica ownership to the Amazon Web Services account that owns the destination bucket by specifying the AccessControlTranslation property, this is the account ID of the destination bucket owner. For more information, see Replication Additional Configuration: Changing the Replica Owner in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nStorageClass -> (string)\n\nThe storage class to use when replicating objects, such as S3 Standard or reduced redundancy. By default, Amazon S3 uses the storage class of the source object to create the object replica.\n\nFor valid values, see the StorageClass element of the PUT Bucket replication action in the Amazon S3 API Reference .\n\nAccessControlTranslation -> (structure)\n\nSpecify this only in a cross-account scenario (where source and destination bucket owners are not the same), and you want to change replica ownership to the Amazon Web Services account that owns the destination bucket. If this is not specified in the replication configuration, the replicas are owned by same Amazon Web Services account that owns the source object.\n\nOwner -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the replica ownership. For default and valid values, see PUT bucket replication in the Amazon S3 API Reference .\n\nEncryptionConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nA container that provides information about encryption. If SourceSelectionCriteria is specified, you must specify this element.\n\nReplicaKmsKeyID -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the ID (Key ARN or Alias ARN) of the customer managed Amazon Web Services KMS key stored in Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (KMS) for the destination bucket. Amazon S3 uses this key to encrypt replica objects. Amazon S3 only supports symmetric, customer managed KMS keys. For more information, see Using symmetric and asymmetric keys in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service Developer Guide .\n\nReplicationTime -> (structure)\n\nA container specifying S3 Replication Time Control (S3 RTC), including whether S3 RTC is enabled and the time when all objects and operations on objects must be replicated.

      "command_description": "Description\n\nAdds an object to a bucket. You must have WRITE permissions on a bucket to add an object to it.\n\nAmazon S3 never adds partial objects; if you receive a success response, Amazon S3 added the entire object to the bucket.\n\nAmazon S3 is a distributed system. If it receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it overwrites all but the last object written. Amazon S3 does not provide object locking; if you need this, make sure to build it into your application layer or use versioning instead.\n\nTo ensure that data is not corrupted traversing the network, use the Content-MD5 header. When you use this header, Amazon S3 checks the object against the provided MD5 value and, if they do not match, returns an error. Additionally, you can calculate the MD5 while putting an object to Amazon S3 and compare the returned ETag to the calculated MD5 value.\n\nNote\n\nTo successfully complete the PutObject request, you must have the s3:PutObject in your IAM permissions.\n\nTo successfully change the objects acl of your PutObject request, you must have the s3:PutObjectAcl in your IAM permissions.\n\nThe Content-MD5 header is required for any request to upload an object with a retention period configured using Amazon S3 Object Lock. For more information about Amazon S3 Object Lock, see Amazon S3 Object Lock Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nServer-side Encryption\n\nYou can optionally request server-side encryption. With server-side encryption, Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts the data when you access it. You have the option to provide your own encryption key or use Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS). For more information, see Using Server-Side Encryption .\n\nIf you request server-side encryption using Amazon Web Services Key Management Service (SSE-KMS), you can enable an S3 Bucket Key at the object-level. For more information, see Amazon S3 Bucket Keys in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nAccess Control List (ACL)-Specific Request Headers\n\nYou can use headers to grant ACL- based permissions. By default, all objects are private. Only the owner has full access control. When adding a new object, you can grant permissions to individual Amazon Web Services accounts or to predefined groups defined by Amazon S3. These permissions are then added to the ACL on the object. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview and Managing ACLs Using the REST API .\n\nStorage Class Options\n\nBy default, Amazon S3 uses the STANDARD Storage Class to store newly created objects. The STANDARD storage class provides high durability and high availability. Depending on performance needs, you can specify a different Storage Class. Amazon S3 on Outposts only uses the OUTPOSTS Storage Class. For more information, see Storage Classes in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nVersioning\n\nIf you enable versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 automatically generates a unique version ID for the object being stored. Amazon S3 returns this ID in the response. When you enable versioning for a bucket, if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of the objects.\n\nFor more information about versioning, see Adding Objects to Versioning Enabled Buckets . For information about returning the versioning state of a bucket, see GetBucketVersioning .\n\nRelated Resources\n\nCopyObject\n\nDeleteObject\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

You must have WRITE_ACP permission to set the ACL of an object. For more information, see What permissions can I grant? in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nThis action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.\n\nDepending on your application needs, you can choose to set the ACL on an object using either the request body or the headers. For example, if you have an existing application that updates a bucket ACL using the request body, you can continue to use that approach. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nAccess Permissions\n\nYou can set access permissions using one of the following methods:\n\nSpecify a canned ACL with the x-amz-acl request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of x-amz-ac l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see Canned ACL .\n\nSpecify access permissions explicitly with the x-amz-grant-read , x-amz-grant-read-acp , x-amz-grant-write-acp , and x-amz-grant-full-control headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (Amazon Web Services accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use x-amz-acl header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see Access Control List (ACL) Overview . You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:\n\nid – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an Amazon Web Services account\n\nuri – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group\n\nemailAddress – if the value specified is the email address of an Amazon Web Services account\n\nNote\n\nUsing email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:\n\nUS East (N. Virginia)\n\nUS West (N. California)\n\nUS West (Oregon)\n\nAsia Pacific (Singapore)\n\nAsia Pacific (Sydney)\n\nAsia Pacific (Tokyo)\n\nEurope (Ireland)\n\nSouth America (São Paulo)\n\nFor a list of all the Amazon S3 supported Regions and endpoints, see Regions and Endpoints in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.\n\nFor example, the following x-amz-grant-read header grants list objects permission to the two Amazon Web Services accounts identified by their email addresses.\n\nx-amz-grant-read: emailAddress=\"xyz@amazon.com\", emailAddress=\"abc@amazon.com\"\n\nYou can use either a canned ACL or specify access permissions explicitly. You cannot do both.\n\nGrantee Values\n\nYou can specify the person (grantee) to whom you’re assigning access rights (using request elements) in the following ways:\n\nBy the person’s ID: <Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"CanonicalUser\"><ID><>ID<></ID><DisplayName><>GranteesEmail<></DisplayName> </Grantee> DisplayName is optional and ignored in the request.\n\nBy URI: <Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"Group\"><URI><>http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AuthenticatedUsers<></URI></Grantee>\n\nBy Email address: <Grantee xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:type=\"AmazonCustomerByEmail\"><EmailAddress><>Grantees@email.com<></EmailAddress>lt;/Grantee> The grantee is resolved to the CanonicalUser and, in a response to a GET Object acl request, appears as the CanonicalUser.\n\nNote\n\nUsing email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following Amazon Web Services Regions:\n\nUS East (N.

      "command_description": "Description\n\nRestores an archived copy of an object back into Amazon S3\n\nThis action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.\n\nThis action performs the following types of requests:\n\nselect - Perform a select query on an archived object\n\nrestore an archive - Restore an archived object\n\nTo use this operation, you must have permissions to perform the s3:RestoreObject action. The bucket owner has this permission by default and can grant this permission to others. For more information about permissions, see Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations and Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nQuerying Archives with Select Requests\n\nYou use a select type of request to perform SQL queries on archived objects. The archived objects that are being queried by the select request must be formatted as uncompressed comma-separated values (CSV) files. You can run queries and custom analytics on your archived data without having to restore your data to a hotter Amazon S3 tier. For an overview about select requests, see Querying Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nWhen making a select request, do the following:\n\nDefine an output location for the select query’s output. This must be an Amazon S3 bucket in the same Amazon Web Services Region as the bucket that contains the archive object that is being queried. The Amazon Web Services account that initiates the job must have permissions to write to the S3 bucket. You can specify the storage class and encryption for the output objects stored in the bucket. For more information about output, see Querying Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide . For more information about the S3 structure in the request body, see the following:\n\nPutObject\n\nManaging Access with ACLs in the Amazon S3 User Guide\n\nProtecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide\n\nDefine the SQL expression for the SELECT type of restoration for your query in the request body’s SelectParameters structure. You can use expressions like the following examples.\n\nThe following expression returns all records from the specified object. SELECT * FROM Object\n\nAssuming that you are not using any headers for data stored in the object, you can specify columns with positional headers. SELECT s._1, s._2 FROM Object s WHERE s._3 > 100\n\nIf you have headers and you set the fileHeaderInfo in the CSV structure in the request body to USE , you can specify headers in the query. (If you set the fileHeaderInfo field to IGNORE , the first row is skipped for the query.) You cannot mix ordinal positions with header column names. SELECT s.Id, s.FirstName, s.SSN FROM S3Object s\n\nFor more information about using SQL with S3 Glacier Select restore, see SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nWhen making a select request, you can also do the following:\n\nTo expedite your queries, specify the Expedited tier. For more information about tiers, see “Restoring Archives,” later in this topic.\n\nSpecify details about the data serialization format of both the input object that is being queried and the serialization of the CSV-encoded query results.\n\nThe following are additional important facts about the select feature:\n\nThe output results are new Amazon S3 objects. Unlike archive retrievals, they are stored until explicitly deleted-manually or through a lifecycle policy.\n\nYou can issue more than one select request on the same Amazon S3 object. Amazon S3 doesn’t deduplicate requests, so avoid issuing duplicate requests.\n\nAmazon S3 accepts a select request even if the object has already been restored. A select request doesn’t return error response 409 .\n\nRestoring objects\n\nObjects that you archive to the S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class, and S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tiers are not accessible in real time. For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.\n\nTo restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don’t provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.\n\nWhen restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the Tier element of the request body:\n\n**Expedited ** - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.\n\n**Standard ** - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.\n\n**Bulk ** - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.\n\nFor more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for Expedited data access, see Restoring Archived Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nYou can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nTo get the status of object restoration, you can send a HEAD request. Operations return the x-amz-restore header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nAfter restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.\n\nIf your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days. For more information about lifecycle configuration, see PutBucketLifecycleConfiguration and Object Lifecycle Management in Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nResponses\n\nA successful action returns either the 200 OK or 202 Accepted status code.\n\nIf the object is not previously restored, then Amazon S3 returns 202 Accepted in the response.\n\nIf the object is previously restored, Amazon S3 returns 200 OK in the response.\n\nSpecial Errors\n\nCode: RestoreAlreadyInProgress\n\nCause: Object restore is already in progress. (This error does not apply to SELECT type requests.)\n\nHTTP Status Code: 409 Conflict\n\nSOAP Fault Code Prefix: Client\n\nCode: GlacierExpeditedRetrievalNotAvailable\n\nCause: expedited retrievals are currently not available. Try again later. (Returned if there is insufficient capacity to process the Expedited request. This error applies only to Expedited retrievals and not to S3 Standard or Bulk retrievals.)\n\nHTTP Status Code: 503\n\nSOAP Fault Code Prefix: N/A\n\nRelated Resources\n\nPutBucketLifecycleConfiguration\n\nGetBucketNotificationConfiguration\n\nSQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select in the Amazon S3 User Guide\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

In the request, along with the SQL expression, you must also specify a data serialization format (JSON, CSV, or Apache Parquet) of the object. Amazon S3 uses this format to parse object data into records, and returns only records that match the specified SQL expression. You must also specify the data serialization format for the response.\n\nThis action is not supported by Amazon S3 on Outposts.\n\nFor more information about Amazon S3 Select, see Selecting Content from Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nFor more information about using SQL with Amazon S3 Select, see SQL Reference for Amazon S3 Select and S3 Glacier Select in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nPermissions\n\nYou must have s3:GetObject permission for this operation. Amazon S3 Select does not support anonymous access. For more information about permissions, see Specifying Permissions in a Policy in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nObject Data Formats\n\nYou can use Amazon S3 Select to query objects that have the following format properties:\n\nCSV, JSON, and Parquet - Objects must be in CSV, JSON, or Parquet format.\n\nUTF-8 - UTF-8 is the only encoding type Amazon S3 Select supports.\n\nGZIP or BZIP2 - CSV and JSON files can be compressed using GZIP or BZIP2. GZIP and BZIP2 are the only compression formats that Amazon S3 Select supports for CSV and JSON files. Amazon S3 Select supports columnar compression for Parquet using GZIP or Snappy. Amazon S3 Select does not support whole-object compression for Parquet objects.\n\nServer-side encryption - Amazon S3 Select supports querying objects that are protected with server-side encryption. For objects that are encrypted with customer-provided encryption keys (SSE-C), you must use HTTPS, and you must use the headers that are documented in the GetObject . For more information about SSE-C, see Server-Side Encryption (Using Customer-Provided Encryption Keys) in the Amazon S3 User Guide . For objects that are encrypted with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) and Amazon Web Services KMS keys (SSE-KMS), server-side encryption is handled transparently, so you don’t need to specify anything. For more information about server-side encryption, including SSE-S3 and SSE-KMS, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nWorking with the Response Body\n\nGiven the response size is unknown, Amazon S3 Select streams the response as a series of messages and includes a Transfer-Encoding header with chunked as its value in the response. For more information, see Appendix: SelectObjectContent Response .\n\nGetObject Support\n\nThe SelectObjectContent action does not support the following GetObject functionality. For more information, see GetObject .\n\nRange : Although you can specify a scan range for an Amazon S3 Select request (see SelectObjectContentRequest - ScanRange in the request parameters), you cannot specify the range of bytes of an object to return.\n\nGLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE and REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage classes: You cannot specify the GLACIER, DEEP_ARCHIVE, or REDUCED_REDUNDANCY storage classes.

However, you have an option to specify your existing Amazon S3 object as a data source for the part you are uploading. To upload a part from an existing object, you use the UploadPartCopy operation.\n\nYou must initiate a multipart upload (see CreateMultipartUpload ) before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request, Amazon S3 returns an upload ID, a unique identifier, that you must include in your upload part request.\n\nPart numbers can be any number from 1 to 10,000, inclusive. A part number uniquely identifies a part and also defines its position within the object being created. If you upload a new part using the same part number that was used with a previous part, the previously uploaded part is overwritten. Each part must be at least 5 MB in size, except the last part. There is no size limit on the last part of your multipart upload.\n\nTo ensure that data is not corrupted when traversing the network, specify the Content-MD5 header in the upload part request. Amazon S3 checks the part data against the provided MD5 value. If they do not match, Amazon S3 returns an error.\n\nIf the upload request is signed with Signature Version 4, then Amazon Web Services S3 uses the x-amz-content-sha256 header as a checksum instead of Content-MD5 . For more information see Authenticating Requests: Using the Authorization Header (Amazon Web Services Signature Version 4) .\n\nNote: After you initiate multipart upload and upload one or more parts, you must either complete or abort multipart upload in order to stop getting charged for storage of the uploaded parts. Only after you either complete or abort multipart upload, Amazon S3 frees up the parts storage and stops charging you for the parts storage.\n\nFor more information on multipart uploads, go to Multipart Upload Overview in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nFor information on the permissions required to use the multipart upload API, go to Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nYou can optionally request server-side encryption where Amazon S3 encrypts your data as it writes it to disks in its data centers and decrypts it for you when you access it. You have the option of providing your own encryption key, or you can use the Amazon Web Services managed encryption keys. If you choose to provide your own encryption key, the request headers you provide in the request must match the headers you used in the request to initiate the upload by using CreateMultipartUpload . For more information, go to Using Server-Side Encryption in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nServer-side encryption is supported by the S3 Multipart Upload actions. Unless you are using a customer-provided encryption key, you don’t need to specify the encryption parameters in each UploadPart request. Instead, you only need to specify the server-side encryption parameters in the initial Initiate Multipart request. For more information, see CreateMultipartUpload .\n\nIf you requested server-side encryption using a customer-provided encryption key in your initiate multipart upload request, you must provide identical encryption information in each part upload using the following headers.\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key\n\nx-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-key-MD5\n\nSpecial Errors\n\nCode: NoSuchUpload\n\nCause: The specified multipart upload does not exist.

You specify the data source by adding the request header x-amz-copy-source in your request and a byte range by adding the request header x-amz-copy-source-range in your request.\n\nThe minimum allowable part size for a multipart upload is 5 MB. For more information about multipart upload limits, go to Quick Facts in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nNote\n\nInstead of using an existing object as part data, you might use the UploadPart action and provide data in your request.\n\nYou must initiate a multipart upload before you can upload any part. In response to your initiate request. Amazon S3 returns a unique identifier, the upload ID, that you must include in your upload part request.\n\nFor more information about using the UploadPartCopy operation, see the following:\n\nFor conceptual information about multipart uploads, see Uploading Objects Using Multipart Upload in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nFor information about permissions required to use the multipart upload API, see Multipart Upload and Permissions in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nFor information about copying objects using a single atomic action vs. the multipart upload, see Operations on Objects in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nFor information about using server-side encryption with customer-provided encryption keys with the UploadPartCopy operation, see CopyObject and UploadPart .\n\nNote the following additional considerations about the request headers x-amz-copy-source-if-match , x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match , x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since , and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since :\n\nConsideration 1 - If both of the x-amz-copy-source-if-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since headers are present in the request as follows: x-amz-copy-source-if-match condition evaluates to true , and; x-amz-copy-source-if-unmodified-since condition evaluates to false ; Amazon S3 returns 200 OK and copies the data.\n\nConsideration 2 - If both of the x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match and x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since headers are present in the request as follows: x-amz-copy-source-if-none-match condition evaluates to false , and; x-amz-copy-source-if-modified-since condition evaluates to true ; Amazon S3 returns 412 Precondition Failed response code.\n\nVersioning\n\nIf your bucket has versioning enabled, you could have multiple versions of the same object. By default, x-amz-copy-source identifies the current version of the object to copy. If the current version is a delete marker and you don’t specify a versionId in the x-amz-copy-source , Amazon S3 returns a 404 error, because the object does not exist. If you specify versionId in the x-amz-copy-source and the versionId is a delete marker, Amazon S3 returns an HTTP 400 error, because you are not allowed to specify a delete marker as a version for the x-amz-copy-source .\n\nYou can optionally specify a specific version of the source object to copy by adding the versionId subresource as shown in the following example:\n\nx-amz-copy-source: /bucket/object?versionId=version id\n\nSpecial Errors\n\nCode: NoSuchUpload\n\nCause: The specified multipart upload does not exist. The upload ID might be invalid, or the multipart upload might have been aborted or completed.\n\nHTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found\n\nCode: InvalidRequest\n\nCause: The specified copy source is not supported as a byte-range copy source.\n\nHTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request\n\nRelated Resources\n\nCreateMultipartUpload\n\nUploadPart\n\nCompleteMultipartUpload\n\nAbortMultipartUpload\n\nListParts\n\nListMultipartUploads\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

When using this action with an access point through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the access point ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about access point ARNs, see Using access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nWhen using this action with Amazon S3 on Outposts, you must direct requests to the S3 on Outposts hostname. The S3 on Outposts hostname takes the form AccessPointName -AccountId .*outpostID* .s3-outposts.*Region* .amazonaws.com. When using this action using S3 on Outposts through the Amazon Web Services SDKs, you provide the Outposts bucket ARN in place of the bucket name. For more information about S3 on Outposts ARNs, see Using S3 on Outposts in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\n--copy-source (string)\n\nSpecifies the source object for the copy operation. You specify the value in one of two formats, depending on whether you want to access the source object through an access point :\n\nFor objects not accessed through an access point, specify the name of the source bucket and key of the source object, separated by a slash (/). For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf from the bucket awsexamplebucket , use awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.\n\nFor objects accessed through access points, specify the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the object as accessed through the access point, in the format arn:aws:s3:<Region>:<account-id>:accesspoint/<access-point-name>/object/<key> . For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through access point my-access-point owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2 , use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/my-access-point/object/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.\n\nNote\n\nAmazon S3 supports copy operations using access points only when the source and destination buckets are in the same Amazon Web Services Region.\n\nAlternatively, for objects accessed through Amazon S3 on Outposts, specify the ARN of the object as accessed in the format arn:aws:s3-outposts:<Region>:<account-id>:outpost/<outpost-id>/object/<key> . For example, to copy the object reports/january.pdf through outpost my-outpost owned by account 123456789012 in Region us-west-2 , use the URL encoding of arn:aws:s3-outposts:us-west-2:123456789012:outpost/my-outpost/object/reports/january.pdf . The value must be URL encoded.\n\nTo copy a specific version of an object, append ?versionId=<version-id> to the value (for example, awsexamplebucket/reports/january.pdf?versionId=QUpfdndhfd8438MNFDN93jdnJFkdmqnh893 ). If you don’t specify a version ID, Amazon S3 copies the latest version of the source object.\n\n--copy-source-if-match (string)\n\nCopies the object if its entity tag (ETag) matches the specified tag.\n\n--copy-source-if-modified-since (timestamp)\n\nCopies the object if it has been modified since the specified time.\n\n--copy-source-if-none-match (string)\n\nCopies the object if its entity tag (ETag) is different than the specified ETag.\n\n--copy-source-if-unmodified-since (timestamp)\n\nCopies the object if it hasn’t been modified since the specified time.\n\n--copy-source-range (string)\n\nThe range of bytes to copy from the source object. The range value must use the form bytes=first-last, where the first and last are the zero-based byte offsets to copy. For example, bytes=0-9 indicates that you want to copy the first 10 bytes of the source. You can copy a range only if the source object is greater than 5 MB.\n\n--key (string)\n\nObject key for which the multipart upload was initiated.\n\n--part-number (integer)\n\nPart number of part being copied. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.\n\n--upload-id (string)\n\nUpload ID identifying the multipart upload whose part is being copied.\n\n--sse-customer-algorithm (string)\n\nSpecifies the algorithm to use to when encrypting the object (for example, AES256).\n\n--sse-customer-key (string)\n\nSpecifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use in encrypting data. This value is used to store the object and then it is discarded; Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key. The key must be appropriate for use with the algorithm specified in the x-amz-server-side-encryption-customer-algorithm header. This must be the same encryption key specified in the initiate multipart upload request.\n\n--sse-customer-key-md5 (string)\n\nSpecifies the 128-bit MD5 digest of the encryption key according to RFC 1321. Amazon S3 uses this header for a message integrity check to ensure that the encryption key was transmitted without error.\n\n--copy-source-sse-customer-algorithm (string)\n\nSpecifies the algorithm to use when decrypting the source object (for example, AES256).\n\n--copy-source-sse-customer-key (string)\n\nSpecifies the customer-provided encryption key for Amazon S3 to use to decrypt the source object.

For information about Object Lambda access points, see Transforming objects with Object Lambda access points in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nThis operation supports metadata that can be returned by GetObject , in addition to RequestRoute , RequestToken , StatusCode , ErrorCode , and ErrorMessage . The GetObject response metadata is supported so that the WriteGetObjectResponse caller, typically an Lambda function, can provide the same metadata when it internally invokes GetObject . When WriteGetObjectResponse is called by a customer-owned Lambda function, the metadata returned to the end user GetObject call might differ from what Amazon S3 would normally return.\n\nYou can include any number of metadata headers. When including a metadata header, it should be prefaced with x-amz-meta . For example, x-amz-meta-my-custom-header: MyCustomValue . The primary use case for this is to forward GetObject metadata.\n\nAmazon Web Services provides some prebuilt Lambda functions that you can use with S3 Object Lambda to detect and redact personally identifiable information (PII) and decompress S3 objects. These Lambda functions are available in the Amazon Web Services Serverless Application Repository, and can be selected through the Amazon Web Services Management Console when you create your Object Lambda access point.\n\nExample 1: PII Access Control - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically detects personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.\n\nExample 2: PII Redaction - This Lambda function uses Amazon Comprehend, a natural language processing (NLP) service using machine learning to find insights and relationships in text. It automatically redacts personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, addresses, dates, credit card numbers, and social security numbers from documents in your Amazon S3 bucket.\n\nExample 3: Decompression - The Lambda function S3ObjectLambdaDecompression, is equipped to decompress objects stored in S3 in one of six compressed file formats including bzip2, gzip, snappy, zlib, zstandard and ZIP.\n\nFor information on how to view and use these functions, see Using Amazon Web Services built Lambda functions in the Amazon S3 User Guide .\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",
