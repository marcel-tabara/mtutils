For ALLOW , all in-scope security group rules must be within the allowed range of the policy’s security group rules. For DENY , all in-scope security group rules must not contain a value or a range that matches a rule value or range in the policy security group.\n\nExample: SECURITY_GROUPS_USAGE_AUDIT \"{\\\"type\\\":\\\"SECURITY_GROUPS_USAGE_AUDIT\\\",\\\"deleteUnusedSecurityGroups\\\":true,\\\"coalesceRedundantSecurityGroups\\\":true}\"\n\nResourceType -> (string)\n\nThe type of resource protected by or in scope of the policy. This is in the format shown in the Amazon Web Services Resource Types Reference . To apply this policy to multiple resource types, specify a resource type of ResourceTypeList and then specify the resource types in a ResourceTypeList .\n\nFor WAF and Shield Advanced, example resource types include AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer and AWS::CloudFront::Distribution . For a security group common policy, valid values are AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface and AWS::EC2::Instance . For a security group content audit policy, valid values are AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup , AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface , and AWS::EC2::Instance . For a security group usage audit policy, the value is AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup . For an Network Firewall policy or DNS Firewall policy, the value is AWS::EC2::VPC .\n\nResourceTypeList -> (list)\n\nAn array of ResourceType objects. Use this only to specify multiple resource types. To specify a single resource type, use ResourceType .\n\n(string)\n\nResourceTags -> (list)\n\nAn array of ResourceTag objects.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe resource tags that Firewall Manager uses to determine if a particular resource should be included or excluded from the Firewall Manager policy. Tags enable you to categorize your Amazon Web Services resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. Firewall Manager combines the tags with “AND” so that, if you add more than one tag to a policy scope, a resource must have all the specified tags to be included or excluded. For more information, see Working with Tag Editor .\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nThe resource tag key.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe resource tag value.\n\nExcludeResourceTags -> (boolean)\n\nIf set to True , resources with the tags that are specified in the ResourceTag array are not in scope of the policy. If set to False , and the ResourceTag array is not null, only resources with the specified tags are in scope of the policy.\n\nRemediationEnabled -> (boolean)\n\nIndicates if the policy should be automatically applied to new resources.\n\nDeleteUnusedFMManagedResources -> (boolean)\n\nIndicates whether Firewall Manager should delete Firewall Manager managed resources, such as web ACLs and security groups, when they are not in use by the Firewall Manager policy. By default, Firewall Manager doesn’t delete unused Firewall Manager managed resources. This option is not available for Shield Advanced or WAF Classic policies.\n\nIncludeMap -> (map)\n\nSpecifies the Amazon Web Services account IDs and Organizations organizational units (OUs) to include in the policy. Specifying an OU is the equivalent of specifying all accounts in the OU and in any of its child OUs, including any child OUs and accounts that are added at a later time.\n\nYou can specify inclusions or exclusions, but not both. If you specify an IncludeMap , Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts specified by the IncludeMap , and does not evaluate any ExcludeMap specifications. If you do not specify an IncludeMap , then Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts except for those specified by the ExcludeMap .\n\nYou can specify account IDs, OUs, or a combination:\n\nSpecify account IDs by setting the key to ACCOUNT . For example, the following is a valid map: {“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”]} .\n\nSpecify OUs by setting the key to ORG_UNIT . For example, the following is a valid map: {“ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]} .\n\nSpecify accounts and OUs together in a single map, separated with a comma. For example, the following is a valid map: {“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”], “ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]} .\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (list)\n\n(string)\n\nExcludeMap -> (map)\n\nSpecifies the Amazon Web Services account IDs and Organizations organizational units (OUs) to exclude from the policy. Specifying an OU is the equivalent of specifying all accounts in the OU and in any of its child OUs, including any child OUs and accounts that are added at a later time.\n\nYou can specify inclusions or exclusions, but not both. If you specify an IncludeMap , Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts specified by the IncludeMap , and does not evaluate any ExcludeMap specifications. If you do not specify an IncludeMap , then Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts except for those specified by the ExcludeMap .\n\nYou can specify account IDs, OUs, or a combination:\n\nSpecify account IDs by setting the key to ACCOUNT .

For example, the following is a valid map: {“ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]} .\n\nSpecify accounts and OUs together in a single map, separated with a comma. For example, the following is a valid map: {“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”], “ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]} .\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (list)\n\n(string)\n\nPolicyArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the specified policy.",

Tags enable you to categorize your Amazon Web Services resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. Firewall Manager combines the tags with “AND” so that, if you add more than one tag to a policy scope, a resource must have all the specified tags to be included or excluded. For more information, see Working with Tag Editor .\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nThe resource tag key.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe resource tag value.\n\nExcludeResourceTags -> (boolean)\n\nIf set to True , resources with the tags that are specified in the ResourceTag array are not in scope of the policy.

By default, Firewall Manager doesn’t delete unused Firewall Manager managed resources. This option is not available for Shield Advanced or WAF Classic policies.\n\nIncludeMap -> (map)\n\nSpecifies the Amazon Web Services account IDs and Organizations organizational units (OUs) to include in the policy. Specifying an OU is the equivalent of specifying all accounts in the OU and in any of its child OUs, including any child OUs and accounts that are added at a later time.\n\nYou can specify inclusions or exclusions, but not both. If you specify an IncludeMap , Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts specified by the IncludeMap , and does not evaluate any ExcludeMap specifications. If you do not specify an IncludeMap , then Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts except for those specified by the ExcludeMap .\n\nYou can specify account IDs, OUs, or a combination:\n\nSpecify account IDs by setting the key to ACCOUNT . For example, the following is a valid map: {“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”]} .\n\nSpecify OUs by setting the key to ORG_UNIT . For example, the following is a valid map: {“ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]} .\n\nSpecify accounts and OUs together in a single map, separated with a comma.

For ALLOW , all in-scope security group rules must be within the allowed range of the policy’s security group rules. For DENY , all in-scope security group rules must not contain a value or a range that matches a rule value or range in the policy security group.\n\nExample: SECURITY_GROUPS_USAGE_AUDIT \"{\\\"type\\\":\\\"SECURITY_GROUPS_USAGE_AUDIT\\\",\\\"deleteUnusedSecurityGroups\\\":true,\\\"coalesceRedundantSecurityGroups\\\":true}\"\n\nResourceType -> (string)\n\nThe type of resource protected by or in scope of the policy. This is in the format shown in the Amazon Web Services Resource Types Reference . To apply this policy to multiple resource types, specify a resource type of ResourceTypeList and then specify the resource types in a ResourceTypeList .\n\nFor WAF and Shield Advanced, example resource types include AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::LoadBalancer and AWS::CloudFront::Distribution . For a security group common policy, valid values are AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface and AWS::EC2::Instance . For a security group content audit policy, valid values are AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup , AWS::EC2::NetworkInterface , and AWS::EC2::Instance . For a security group usage audit policy, the value is AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup . For an Network Firewall policy or DNS Firewall policy, the value is AWS::EC2::VPC .\n\nResourceTypeList -> (list)\n\nAn array of ResourceType objects. Use this only to specify multiple resource types. To specify a single resource type, use ResourceType .\n\n(string)\n\nResourceTags -> (list)\n\nAn array of ResourceTag objects.\n\n(structure)\n\nThe resource tags that Firewall Manager uses to determine if a particular resource should be included or excluded from the Firewall Manager policy. Tags enable you to categorize your Amazon Web Services resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value. Firewall Manager combines the tags with “AND” so that, if you add more than one tag to a policy scope, a resource must have all the specified tags to be included or excluded. For more information, see Working with Tag Editor .\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nThe resource tag key.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nThe resource tag value.\n\nExcludeResourceTags -> (boolean)\n\nIf set to True , resources with the tags that are specified in the ResourceTag array are not in scope of the policy. If set to False , and the ResourceTag array is not null, only resources with the specified tags are in scope of the policy.\n\nRemediationEnabled -> (boolean)\n\nIndicates if the policy should be automatically applied to new resources.\n\nDeleteUnusedFMManagedResources -> (boolean)\n\nIndicates whether Firewall Manager should delete Firewall Manager managed resources, such as web ACLs and security groups, when they are not in use by the Firewall Manager policy. By default, Firewall Manager doesn’t delete unused Firewall Manager managed resources. This option is not available for Shield Advanced or WAF Classic policies.\n\nIncludeMap -> (map)\n\nSpecifies the Amazon Web Services account IDs and Organizations organizational units (OUs) to include in the policy. Specifying an OU is the equivalent of specifying all accounts in the OU and in any of its child OUs, including any child OUs and accounts that are added at a later time.\n\nYou can specify inclusions or exclusions, but not both. If you specify an IncludeMap , Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts specified by the IncludeMap , and does not evaluate any ExcludeMap specifications. If you do not specify an IncludeMap , then Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts except for those specified by the ExcludeMap .\n\nYou can specify account IDs, OUs, or a combination:\n\nSpecify account IDs by setting the key to ACCOUNT . For example, the following is a valid map: {“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”]} .\n\nSpecify OUs by setting the key to ORG_UNIT . For example, the following is a valid map: {“ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]} .\n\nSpecify accounts and OUs together in a single map, separated with a comma. For example, the following is a valid map: {“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”], “ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]} .\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (list)\n\n(string)\n\nExcludeMap -> (map)\n\nSpecifies the Amazon Web Services account IDs and Organizations organizational units (OUs) to exclude from the policy. Specifying an OU is the equivalent of specifying all accounts in the OU and in any of its child OUs, including any child OUs and accounts that are added at a later time.\n\nYou can specify inclusions or exclusions, but not both. If you specify an IncludeMap , Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts specified by the IncludeMap , and does not evaluate any ExcludeMap specifications. If you do not specify an IncludeMap , then Firewall Manager applies the policy to all accounts except for those specified by the ExcludeMap .\n\nYou can specify account IDs, OUs, or a combination:\n\nSpecify account IDs by setting the key to ACCOUNT . For example, the following is a valid map: {“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”]} .\n\nSpecify OUs by setting the key to ORG_UNIT . For example, the following is a valid map: {“ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]} .\n\nSpecify accounts and OUs together in a single map, separated with a comma. For example, the following is a valid map: {“ACCOUNT” : [“accountID1”, “accountID2”], “ORG_UNIT” : [“ouid111”, “ouid112”]} .\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (list)\n\n(string)\n\nPolicyArn -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the policy.",
