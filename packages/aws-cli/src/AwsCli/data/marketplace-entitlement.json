The results can be filtered based on customer identifier or product dimensions.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.\n\nget-entitlements is a paginated operation. Multiple API calls may be issued in order to retrieve the entire data set of results. You can disable pagination by providing the --no-paginate argument. When using --output text and the --query argument on a paginated response, the --query argument must extract data from the results of the following query expressions: Entitlements",

      "command_options_description": "Options\n\n--product-code (string)\n\nProduct code is used to uniquely identify a product in AWS Marketplace. The product code will be provided by AWS Marketplace when the product listing is created.\n\n--filter (map)\n\nFilter is used to return entitlements for a specific customer or for a specific dimension. Filters are described as keys mapped to a lists of values. Filtered requests are unioned for each value in the value list, and then intersected for each filter key.\n\nkey -> (string)\n\nvalue -> (list)\n\n(string)\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\n  KeyName1=string,string,KeyName2=string,string\n\nWhere valid key names are:\n  CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER\n  DIMENSION\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\"CUSTOMER_IDENTIFIER\"|\"DIMENSION\": [\"string\", ...]\n  ...}\n\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--starting-token (string)\n\nA token to specify where to start paginating. This is the NextToken from a previously truncated response.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--page-size (integer)\n\nThe size of each page to get in the AWS service call. This does not affect the number of items returned in the command’s output. Setting a smaller page size results in more calls to the AWS service, retrieving fewer items in each call. This can help prevent the AWS service calls from timing out.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--max-items (integer)\n\nThe total number of items to return in the command’s output. If the total number of items available is more than the value specified, a NextToken is provided in the command’s output. To resume pagination, provide the NextToken value in the starting-token argument of a subsequent command. Do not use the NextToken response element directly outside of the AWS CLI.\n\nFor usage examples, see Pagination in the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide .\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

If the result contains an empty set of entitlements, NextToken might still be present and should be used.\n\n(structure)\n\nAn entitlement represents capacity in a product owned by the customer. For example, a customer might own some number of users or seats in an SaaS application or some amount of data capacity in a multi-tenant database.\n\nProductCode -> (string)\n\nThe product code for which the given entitlement applies. Product codes are provided by AWS Marketplace when the product listing is created.\n\nDimension -> (string)\n\nThe dimension for which the given entitlement applies. Dimensions represent categories of capacity in a product and are specified when the product is listed in AWS Marketplace.\n\nCustomerIdentifier -> (string)\n\nThe customer identifier is a handle to each unique customer in an application. Customer identifiers are obtained through the ResolveCustomer operation in AWS Marketplace Metering Service.\n\nValue -> (structure)\n\nThe EntitlementValue represents the amount of capacity that the customer is entitled to for the product.\n\nIntegerValue -> (integer)\n\nThe IntegerValue field will be populated with an integer value when the entitlement is an integer type. Otherwise, the field will not be set.\n\nDoubleValue -> (double)\n\nThe DoubleValue field will be populated with a double value when the entitlement is a double type. Otherwise, the field will not be set.\n\nBooleanValue -> (boolean)\n\nThe BooleanValue field will be populated with a boolean value when the entitlement is a boolean type. Otherwise, the field will not be set.\n\nStringValue -> (string)\n\nThe StringValue field will be populated with a string value when the entitlement is a string type. Otherwise, the field will not be set.\n\nExpirationDate -> (timestamp)\n\nThe expiration date represents the minimum date through which this entitlement is expected to remain valid. For contractual products listed on AWS Marketplace, the expiration date is the date at which the customer will renew or cancel their contract. Customers who are opting to renew their contract will still have entitlements with an expiration date.\n\nNextToken -> (string)\n\nFor paginated results, use NextToken in subsequent calls to GetEntitlements. If the result contains an empty set of entitlements, NextToken might still be present and should be used."
