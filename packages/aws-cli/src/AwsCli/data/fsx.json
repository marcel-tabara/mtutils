Creating regular backups is a best practice, enabling you to restore a file system or volume from a backup if an issue arises with the original file system or volume.\n\nFor Amazon FSx for Lustre file systems, you can create a backup only for file systems with the following configuration:\n\na Persistent deployment type\n\nis not linked to a data repository.\n\nFor more information about backups, see the following:\n\nFor Amazon FSx for Lustre, see Working with FSx for Lustre backups .\n\nFor Amazon FSx for Windows, see Working with FSx for Windows backups .\n\nFor Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, see Working with FSx for NetApp ONTAP backups .\n\nIf a backup with the specified client request token exists, and the parameters match, this operation returns the description of the existing backup. If a backup specified client request token exists, and the parameters don’t match, this operation returns IncompatibleParameterError . If a backup with the specified client request token doesn’t exist, CreateBackup does the following:\n\nCreates a new Amazon FSx backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING .\n\nReturns the description of the backup.\n\nBy using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateBackup operation without the risk of creating an extra backup. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a backup was created. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a backup, the operation returns a successful result because all the parameters are the same.\n\nThe CreateBackup operation returns while the backup’s lifecycle state is still CREATING . You can check the backup creation status by calling the DescribeBackups operation, which returns the backup state along with other information.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

If a file system specified client request token exists and the parameters don’t match, this call returns IncompatibleParameterError . If a file system with the specified client request token doesn’t exist, CreateFileSystem does the following:\n\nCreates a new, empty Amazon FSx file system with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING .\n\nReturns the description of the file system.\n\nThis operation requires a client request token in the request that Amazon FSx uses to ensure idempotent creation. This means that calling the operation multiple times with the same client request token has no effect. By using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateFileSystem operation without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.\n\nNote\n\nThe CreateFileSystem call returns while the file system’s lifecycle state is still CREATING . You can check the file-system creation status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system state along with other information.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

If a client request token specified by the file system exists and the parameters don’t match, this call returns IncompatibleParameterError . If a file system with the specified client request token doesn’t exist, this operation does the following:\n\nCreates a new Amazon FSx file system from backup with an assigned ID, and an initial lifecycle state of CREATING .\n\nReturns the description of the file system.\n\nParameters like Active Directory, default share name, automatic backup, and backup settings default to the parameters of the file system that was backed up, unless overridden. You can explicitly supply other settings.\n\nBy using the idempotent operation, you can retry a CreateFileSystemFromBackup call without the risk of creating an extra file system. This approach can be useful when an initial call fails in a way that makes it unclear whether a file system was created. Examples are if a transport level timeout occurred, or your connection was reset. If you use the same client request token and the initial call created a file system, the client receives success as long as the parameters are the same.\n\nNote\n\nThe CreateFileSystemFromBackup call returns while the file system’s lifecycle state is still CREATING . You can check the file-system creation status by calling the DescribeFileSystems operation, which returns the file system state along with other information.\n\nSee also: AWS API Documentation\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",

Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .\n\nSNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold snapshots to the capacity pool storage tier.\n\nAUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots to the capacity pool storage tier based on your access patterns.\n\nALL - moves all user data blocks in both the active file system and Snapshot copies to the storage pool tier.\n\nNONE - keeps a volume’s data in the primary storage tier, preventing it from being moved to the capacity pool tier.\n\nShorthand Syntax:\n\nJunctionPath=string,SecurityStyle=string,SizeInMegabytes=integer,StorageEfficiencyEnabled=boolean,TieringPolicy={CoolingPeriod=integer,Name=string}\n\n\nJSON Syntax:\n\n{\n  \"JunctionPath\": \"string\",\n  \"SecurityStyle\": \"UNIX\"|\"NTFS\"|\"MIXED\",\n  \"SizeInMegabytes\": integer,\n  \"StorageEfficiencyEnabled\": true|false,\n  \"TieringPolicy\": {\n    \"CoolingPeriod\": integer,\n    \"Name\": \"SNAPSHOT_ONLY\"|\"AUTO\"|\"ALL\"|\"NONE\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n--cli-input-json | --cli-input-yaml (string) Reads arguments from the JSON string provided. The JSON string follows the format provided by --generate-cli-skeleton. If other arguments are provided on the command line, those values will override the JSON-provided values. It is not possible to pass arbitrary binary values using a JSON-provided value as the string will be taken literally. This may not be specified along with --cli-input-yaml.\n\n--generate-cli-skeleton (string) Prints a JSON skeleton to standard output without sending an API request. If provided with no value or the value input, prints a sample input JSON that can be used as an argument for --cli-input-json. Similarly, if provided yaml-input it will print a sample input YAML that can be used with --cli-input-yaml. If provided with the value output, it validates the command inputs and returns a sample output JSON for that command.\n\nSee ‘aws help’ for descriptions of global parameters.",
      "command_output": "Output\n\nVolume -> (structure)\n\nReturned after a successful UpdateVolume API operation, describing the volume just updated.\n\nCreationTime -> (timestamp)\n\nThe time that the resource was created, in seconds (since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z), also known as Unix time.\n\nFileSystemId -> (string)\n\nThe globally unique ID of the file system, assigned by Amazon FSx.\n\nLifecycle -> (string)\n\nThe lifecycle status of the volume.\n\nCREATED - The volume is fully available for use.\n\nCREATING - Amazon FSx is creating the new volume.\n\nDELETING - Amazon FSx is deleting an existing volume.\n\nFAILED - Amazon FSx was unable to create the volume.\n\nMISCONFIGURED - The volume is in a failed but recoverable state.\n\nPENDING - Amazon FSx has not started creating the volume.\n\nName -> (string)\n\nThe name of the volume.\n\nOntapConfiguration -> (structure)\n\nThe configuration of an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP volume\n\nFlexCacheEndpointType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the FlexCache endpoint type of the volume. Valid values are the following:\n\nNONE specifies that the volume doesn’t have a FlexCache configuration. NONE is the default.\n\nORIGIN specifies that the volume is the origin volume for a FlexCache volume.\n\nCACHE specifies that the volume is a FlexCache volume.\n\nJunctionPath -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the directory that NAS clients use to mount the volume, along with the SVM DNS name or IP address. You can create a JunctionPath directly below a parent volume junction or on a directory within a volume. A JunctionPath for a volume named vol3 might be /vol1/vol2/vol3, or /vol1/dir2/vol3, or even /dir1/dir2/vol3..\n\nSecurityStyle -> (string)\n\nThe security style for the volume, which can be UNIX , NTFS , or MIXED .\n\nSizeInMegabytes -> (integer)\n\nThe configured size of the volume, in megabytes (MBs).\n\nStorageEfficiencyEnabled -> (boolean)\n\nThe volume’s storage efficiency setting.\n\nStorageVirtualMachineId -> (string)\n\nThe ID of the volume’s storage virtual machine.\n\nStorageVirtualMachineRoot -> (boolean)\n\nA boolean flag indicating whether this volume is the root volume for its storage virtual machine (SVM). Only one volume on an SVM can be the root volume. This value defaults to false. If this value is true, then this is the SVM root volume.\n\nThis flag is useful when you’re deleting an SVM, because you must first delete all non-root volumes. This flag, when set to false, helps you identify which volumes to delete before you can delete the SVM.\n\nTieringPolicy -> (structure)\n\nThe volume’s TieringPolicy setting.\n\nCoolingPeriod -> (integer)\n\nSpecifies the number of days that user data in a volume must remain inactive before it is considered “cold” and moved to the capacity pool. Used with the AUTO and SNAPSHOT_ONLY tiering policies. Enter a whole number between 2 and 183. Default values are 31 days for AUTO and 2 days for SNAPSHOT_ONLY .\n\nName -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the tiering policy used to transition data. Default value is SNAPSHOT_ONLY .\n\nSNAPSHOT_ONLY - moves cold snapshots to the capacity pool storage tier.\n\nAUTO - moves cold user data and snapshots to the capacity pool storage tier based on your access patterns.\n\nALL - moves all user data blocks in both the active file system and Snapshot copies to the storage pool tier.\n\nNONE - keeps a volume’s data in the primary storage tier, preventing it from being moved to the capacity pool tier.\n\nUUID -> (string)\n\nThe volume’s UUID (universally unique identifier).\n\nOntapVolumeType -> (string)\n\nSpecifies the type of volume. Valid values are the following:\n\nRW specifies a read-write volume. RW is the default.\n\nDP specifies a data protection volume. You can protect data by replicating it to data protection mirror copies and use data protection mirror copies to recover data when a disaster occurs.\n\nLS specifies a load-sharing mirror volume. A load-sharing mirror reduces the network traffic to a FlexVol volume by providing additional read-only access to clients.\n\nResourceARN -> (string)\n\nThe Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for a given resource. ARNs uniquely identify Amazon Web Services resources. We require an ARN when you need to specify a resource unambiguously across all of Amazon Web Services. For more information, see Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference .\n\nTags -> (list)\n\nA list of Tag values, with a maximum of 50 elements.\n\n(structure)\n\nSpecifies a key-value pair for a resource tag.\n\nKey -> (string)\n\nA value that specifies the TagKey , the name of the tag. Tag keys must be unique for the resource to which they are attached.\n\nValue -> (string)\n\nA value that specifies the TagValue , the value assigned to the corresponding tag key. Tag values can be null and don’t have to be unique in a tag set. For example, you can have a key-value pair in a tag set of finances : April and also of payroll : April .\n\nVolumeId -> (string)\n\nThe system-generated, unique ID of the volume.\n\nVolumeType -> (string)\n\nThe type of volume; ONTAP is the only valid volume type.\n\nLifecycleTransitionReason -> (structure)\n\nDescribes why the volume lifecycle state changed.\n\nMessage -> (string)\n\nA detailed error message."
